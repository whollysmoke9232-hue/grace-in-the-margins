<blockquote>
<p><em>“What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!”</em><br>
—Romans 6:21</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The Apostle Paul pulls back the curtain on a harsh truth about sin—one we often learn the hard way. He asks a piercing question:</p>
<p><em>What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of?</em></p>
<p>Sin is not only wrong.<br>
It is irrational.</p>
<p>In the moment, sin often feels like relief. Escape. Satisfaction. Freedom. There may be a rush—temporary pleasure or comfort that feels convincing and real. But Paul forces us to look beyond the moment and into the aftermath.</p>
<p>“Those things result in death.”</p>
<p>Not only physical death, but spiritual death. Relational death. Emotional death. The death of peace, trust, and joy.</p>
<p>When we look back, the dominant emotion is rarely fulfillment. It is shame. Not because God delights in our shame, but because sin always over-promises and under-delivers. What sparkled briefly dulls quickly, leaving regret in its wake.</p>
<p>Paul does not soften the truth.<br>
What did those things actually give us?</p>
<p>Pain.<br>
Loss.<br>
Shame.<br>
Death.</p>
<p>Sin advertises freedom while producing bondage. It promises life while quietly hollowing us out.</p>
<p>And yet—God does not leave us there.</p>

<p>Grace meets us in the aftermath.</p>
<p>The gospel does not deny the damage of sin—it names it honestly. But it also refuses to let sin have the final word. In Christ, we are invited out of the grave and back into the garden.</p>
<p>Transformation begins with truth—acknowledging that sin leaves us empty—and continues with trust in the One who fills us with life.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a hidden sin with a lasting reward. What once felt thrilling always ends in loss. But in Christ, we are no longer slaves to what leads to death. We are invited into wisdom, renewal, and freedom.</p>
<p>Recognizing the true nature of sin is not condemnation—it is liberation. It teaches us to flee what destroys and cling to what gives life.</p>

<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You for the clarity of Your Word.<br>
Help me recognize the traps that masquerade as treasures.<br>
Remind me that sin never brings life—only You do.<br>
Give me the courage to turn from foolishness and walk in freedom.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Sin always promises more than it can give.<br>
Grace always gives more than we expect.</p>
