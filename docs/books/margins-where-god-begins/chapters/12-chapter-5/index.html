<p>We tend to measure life by movement.<br>
Progress. Productivity. Momentum.</p>
<p>But God often moves most powerfully in the pause.</p>
<p>The Bible is filled with them—moments of silence, waiting, stillness. Moments when nothing seems to be happening on the surface, but everything is shifting beneath it. These pauses are not empty. They are pregnant with purpose.</p>
<p>They are margins.</p>

<h2 id="the-silence-between-testaments" tabindex="-1">The Silence Between Testaments</h2>
<p>There are 400 years between the final words of Malachi and the opening lines of Matthew. Four centuries of prophetic silence. No new revelations. No angelic visitations. Just silence.</p>
<p>But God wasn’t absent. He was preparing.</p>
<p>In that pause, empires rose and fell. Roads were built. Languages spread. The world was being aligned for the arrival of the Messiah. The silence wasn’t a void—it was a setup.</p>
<p>God was orchestrating the perfect conditions for the Word to become flesh.</p>

<h2 id="the-pause-before-the-resurrection" tabindex="-1">The Pause Before the Resurrection</h2>
<p>There’s a reason we call it “Good Friday” and “Resurrection Sunday.” But what about Saturday?</p>
<p>That in-between day. That silent, uncertain, grief-soaked pause.</p>
<p>The disciples didn’t know Sunday was coming. All they had was silence. Confusion. Fear. Waiting.</p>
<p>But even in the tomb, God was working. Even in the pause, the plan was unfolding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-margins-of-our-lives" tabindex="-1">The Margins of Our Lives</h2>
<p>We all have seasons that feel like pauses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The job that hasn’t come.</li>
<li>The healing that hasn’t happened.</li>
<li>The prayer that hasn’t been answered.</li>
<li>The dream that hasn’t been fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s easy to believe that God is only present in the action—in the breakthroughs, the miracles, the movement. But He is just as present in the waiting. In fact, it’s in those times of waiting that God is closest to us. Healing us. Preparing us. Restoring us. Carrying us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the pause is the point.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-god-builds-in-the-stillness" tabindex="-1">What God Builds in the Stillness</h2>
<p>In the pause, God builds trust.<br>
In the pause, He deepens roots.<br>
In the pause, He prepares us for what’s next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be still, and know that I am God.”<br>
—Psalm 46:10 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stillness is not passivity. It’s surrender. It’s choosing to believe that God is working even when we can’t see it. That He is weaving even when the thread disappears from view.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-sacred-rhythm" tabindex="-1">The Sacred Rhythm</h2>
<p>Creation itself was born in rhythm:</p>
<p>God spoke. Then He paused.<br>
He created. Then He rested.</p>
<p>The pause is part of the pattern. It’s not a disruption—it’s divine design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens…”<br>
—Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Jesus paused. He withdrew to lonely places. He waited for the right hour. He moved in step with the Father’s timing.</p>
<p>If the Son of God embraced the pause, so can we.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>Where in your life are you experiencing a pause?</p>
<p>What if it’s not a delay, but a design?</p>
<p>What if the silence is sacred?</p>
<p>God is not absent in the stillness. He is present. He is preparing. He is speaking—sometimes most clearly—through the quiet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Father, thank You for the pauses. For the stillness. For the silence that speaks. Teach me to trust You when nothing seems to be moving. Help me to rest in the knowledge that You are always working, always weaving, always present. Even in the pause. Especially in the pause. Amen.</p>
