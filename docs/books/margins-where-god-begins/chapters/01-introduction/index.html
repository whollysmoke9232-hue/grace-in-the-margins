<p>What’s your favorite place in the Bible?</p>
<p>Is it a verse? A passage? A chapter? Maybe a book? For some, it’s John 3:16. For others, the nativity. Still others are drawn to the resurrection, the Psalms, the prophets, or the letters of Paul.</p>
<p>I love them all.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many verses that I find challenging and encouraging; and different sections and books that I return to often. I could make a case for each one being my favorite.</p>
<p>But none of them are.</p>
<p>My favorite place in the Bible isn’t a verse at all. It’s a space. A margin. That tiny sliver of white just to the left of Genesis 1:1.</p>
<p>That’s where this journey began.</p>
<p>During a season of stillness, I found myself reading the Bible like never before—cover to cover, again and again. Fourteen times in twenty-two months. And in that saturation, I began to see things I’d never seen before: the thread, the design, the divine choreography.</p>
<p>I saw how every story, every life, every moment was part of something much bigger.</p>
<p>I saw that God was never reacting—He was revealing. That He wasn’t figuring things out—He already knew. That before the first word was spoken, the entire story was already written within the mind of God.</p>
<p>This book is an invitation to step into that margin. To pause. To wonder. To see your life not as a series of disconnected events, but as a thread in the eternal tapestry of God’s plan.</p>
<p>You are not outside of His reach.<br>
You are not outside of His love.<br>
You are already in the margin.</p>
<p>Where God’s plan begins.</p>
