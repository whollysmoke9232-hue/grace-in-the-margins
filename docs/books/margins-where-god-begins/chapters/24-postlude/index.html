<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then I do not merely walk with Him—<br>
I exist within Him.</p>
<p>I breathe in His presence,<br>
and He breathes through mine.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then “as far as the east is from the west”<br>
is still within His embrace.</p>
<p>There is no exile from His love,<br>
no distance from His gaze.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He sees me as I am,<br>
as I was,<br>
and as I will be—<br>
all at once.</p>
<p>Not in sequence, but in fullness.<br>
Not in progress, but in completion.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He knows everything that can be known about me—<br>
and infinitely more.</p>
<p>The things I hide,<br>
the things I fear,<br>
the things I don’t yet understand about myself—<br>
He holds them all without flinching.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then what I call an obstacle<br>
is both there and not there.</p>
<p>It is real in my time,<br>
but resolved in His.<br>
It is a shadow cast by a light I haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He is not “working on me.”<br>
He has already finished.<br>
I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then all of my current and future problems<br>
have already been solved.</p>
<p>All of my questions<br>
already answered.</p>
<p>I am not waiting for clarity—<br>
I am walking toward it.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then maybe when I get to Heaven,<br>
I’ll realize I’ve been there all along.</p>
<p>That eternity was never a destination,<br>
but a dimension I was always tethered to.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then even my sins and weaknesses<br>
will become stained-glass windows—<br>
broken pieces made beautiful<br>
by the light of His grace.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then the power that created galaxies<br>
and raised Jesus from the grave<br>
dwells in me.</p>
<p>Not metaphorically.<br>
Literally.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then I am connected to everything—<br>
because everything exists within Him.</p>
<p>Every atom, every angel,<br>
every moment, every miracle.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then nothing is impossible for me.<br>
Because nothing is impossible for Him.</p>
<p>And He is not just beside me—<br>
He is in me.<br>
And I am in Him.</p>
