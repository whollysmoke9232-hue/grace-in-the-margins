<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>O God, this isn’t about me at all;<br>
it is about You.<br>
It has always been about You.<br>
You alone.</p>
<p>How could I think that any of this was for me?</p>
<p>All of this is to bring You glory.</p>
<p>I can’t see the end.<br>
I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.<br>
Men will turn to You.<br>
They will know that You alone are God.</p>
<p>It is You who rescues.<br>
You who redeems.<br>
You who lifts my soul from the grave.</p>
<p>My life is in Your hands.<br>
There is nowhere I would rather be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;<br>
dishonor has covered my face.”</em><br>
—Psalm 69:7</p>
