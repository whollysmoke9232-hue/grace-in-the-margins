<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>Throughout my life, I’ve been on a road. Along this road, there have been countless events and encounters—each one shaping me, preparing me for something still ahead.</p>
<p>Cause and effect.</p>
<p>The beauty of cause and effect is that every effect becomes a new cause, setting something else in motion.</p>
<p>God has a plan for me. A path I’m meant to follow. But here’s the challenge: I don’t know what’s coming. I can’t see the next bend in the road, let alone prepare for it. That’s why my path is rarely a straight line.</p>
<p>Every detour is necessary.</p>
<p>Some are gentle curves. Others are sharp turns—painful, even jarring. But I’m learning that these detours are not delays. They are divine preparations.</p>
<p>God knows what lies ahead, and He knows what I’ll need when I get there. The lessons I learn in the detour are the tools I’ll need for the next destination.</p>
<p>And then, that destination becomes the next preparation.</p>
<p>So I’m learning to stop fighting.<br>
To stop trying to escape the hard places.<br>
I’m learning to be present.<br>
To live in the moment.<br>
And to leave what’s next in God’s hands.</p>
