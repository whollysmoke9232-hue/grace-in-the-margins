<p><strong>“God still speaks.”</strong></p>
<p>I can’t take credit for this reading plan. It came from the first student I ever mentored in ministry. I’ve used it ever since. And yes—God still speaks.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-your-heart" tabindex="-1">Preparing Your Heart</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set a daily time. Morning, evening, or whenever you’re most focused. The key is consistency and quiet.</li>
<li>Begin with silence. Still your thoughts. Invite God to speak.</li>
<li>Pray for openness. Ask Him to write His Word on your heart.</li>
<li>Don’t worry if you don’t “hear” anything right away. His Word is alive. It’s working in you—whether you feel it or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-read" tabindex="-1">How to Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t read to check a box.</li>
<li>Don’t read to find something to post or preach.</li>
<li>Read slowly. Let the words settle. Let your spirit absorb them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-reading-plan" tabindex="-1">The Reading Plan</h2>
<p><strong>Daily:</strong> Five Psalms + One Chapter of Proverbs</p>
<p>Use the calendar date to guide your reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the 1st of the month, read:<br>
Psalms 1, 31, 61, 91, 121 + Proverbs 1</li>
<li>On the 15th:<br>
Psalms 15, 45, 75, 105, 135 + Proverbs 15</li>
<li>Just add 30 to the day’s date to get your five Psalms.</li>
<li>On the 29th, skip Psalm 119. Save it for months with 31 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>In one month, you’ll read all 150 Psalms and all 31 chapters of Proverbs. Then repeat.</p>
<p>You might think this would get old. I’ve been doing it—off and on—for over forty years. It’s still fresh. And God still speaks.</p>
<h2 id="after-you-read" tabindex="-1">After You Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask God to establish His Word in your spirit.</li>
<li>Ask Him to shape you according to His will.</li>
<li>If you feel a hunger for more, follow it. Expand your reading. There’s no wrong place to start in Scripture.</li>
</ul>
<p>God promises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br>
It will not return to Me empty,<br>
Without accomplishing what I desire,<br>
And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.”</em><br>
—Isaiah 55:11 (NASB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So read. Let His Word pour into your heart.</p>
<p>Then celebrate His work in and through you.</p>
