<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.<br>
I’ve seen Your hand.<br>
I’ve experienced a taste of Your love.<br>
I’ve been given a glimpse of Your glory.<br>
But I want to see more of You.</p>
<p>Purify my heart.<br>
Cleanse me.<br>
Reveal my sin.<br>
Burn away my chaff.<br>
I desire a deep cleansing.</p>
<p>Create in me a clean heart – a new heart<br>
So that all that is left standing in me is You.</p>
<p>I don’t want to remember my sin.<br>
I don’t want to long for sinful things.<br>
I seek You.<br>
I seek Your will – Your perfect will.<br>
Fix my mind in innocence,<br>
My imagination in purity.<br>
Lead me in truth.<br>
Steady me with Your hand.</p>
<p>You are all I need.<br>
You are all I want.<br>
O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.</p>
<p>“Jesus said, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.’”<br>
—Matthew 5:8</p>
