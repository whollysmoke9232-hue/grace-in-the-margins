<p>You’ve walked with me through the margins—<br>
before the beginning,<br>
through the silence,<br>
into the Word,<br>
and across the tapestry of time.</p>
<p>You’ve seen that God is not just the Author of the story—<br>
He is the space in which the story unfolds.</p>
<p>He is before all things,<br>
and in Him, all things hold together.</p>
<p>But this isn’t just a theological truth.<br>
It’s a personal one.</p>
<p>You are not outside of His reach.<br>
You are not outside of His plan.<br>
You are not outside of His love.</p>
<p>You are already in the margin.<br>
Where God lives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-wonder-of-being-known" tabindex="-1">The Wonder of Being Known</h2>
<p>To live in wonder is to live awake.</p>
<p>Awake to the presence of God in the ordinary.<br>
Awake to the eternal in the everyday.<br>
Awake to the truth that you are fully known, fully loved, and fully held.</p>
<p>Wonder doesn’t require answers.<br>
It requires awareness.</p>
<p>It’s not about figuring everything out.<br>
It’s about standing in awe of the One who already has.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invitation" tabindex="-1">The Invitation</h2>
<p>So here’s the invitation:</p>
<p>Live like you are already in the presence of God—because you are.<br>
Live like your story is already known—because it is.<br>
Live like the Word is still speaking—because He is.</p>
<p>Return to the margin often.<br>
Pause.<br>
Listen.<br>
Look again.</p>
<p>Because in that sacred space,<br>
you’ll find the One who was there before the beginning<br>
and who will be there beyond the end.</p>
