<p>If the eternal margin reveals who God is,<br>
and the unfolding margin shows how He moves,<br>
then the living margin is where we respond.</p>
<p>This section explores what it means to live fully aware of God’s presence—not someday, not when everything makes sense, but right here, right now.</p>
<p>The margin is no longer just something we observe.<br>
It is something we inhabit.</p>
