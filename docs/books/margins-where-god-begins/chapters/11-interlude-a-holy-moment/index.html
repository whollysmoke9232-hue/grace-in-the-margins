<p>“The heavens declare the glory of God... They have no speech, they use no words; their voice is not heard.”<br>
—Psalm 19:1–3</p>
<p>This morning, as I read Psalm 19, a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship, I found my gaze drifting out my window. Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward. A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.</p>
<p>I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork. How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze. Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall. This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.</p>
<p>But then, the scene shifted. The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently. It was as though they were waving directly at me. Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement—or was it a dance?—all seemed to be acknowledging my presence. As if to say, “We know you're still there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, ‘Good morning!’”</p>
<p>In that moment, I was utterly overcome. Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over. Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father. And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.</p>
<p>So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees. It was a holy moment, a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made. The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:</p>
<p>You are seen.<br>
You are loved.</p>
