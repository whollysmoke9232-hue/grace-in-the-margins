<p>Before the first word of creation was spoken, God already knew – or better, God already knows.</p>
<p>He knew the shape of the universe, the rhythm of time, the rise and fall of nations. He knew the names of every star and the number of hairs on every head. He knew the sound of your voice before you ever cried your first breath. He knew the choices you would make, the prayers you would whisper, the tears you would shed. He knew all the times you would excel, and all the times you would fail.</p>
<p>He knew.<br>
And He still chose to create.</p>

<h2 id="the-comfort-of-being-known" tabindex="-1">The Comfort of Being Known</h2>
<p>There’s a deep comfort in being known. Not just seen, not just tolerated—but truly, intimately known. We spend so much of our lives trying to be understood, trying to explain ourselves, trying to make sense of our own hearts. But God already knows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“O Lord, you have searched me and known me.<br>
You know when I sit down and when I rise up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.”<br>
—Psalm 139:1–2 (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God doesn’t need to investigate you. He doesn’t need to wait and see how your story unfolds. He already knows every detail of your life from beginning to end—and He loves you anyway. And it’s not because He can see into or predict the future. It’s because He’s there, right now, witnessing your future. Your entire future. Watching it unfold. Even while He is beside you in this moment.</p>
<p>That’s not just comforting. That’s transformational.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan-was-never-plan-b" tabindex="-1">The Plan Was Never Plan B</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful revelations I’ve come to embrace is this: God has never had a Plan B.</p>
<p>The cross wasn’t a reaction. Redemption wasn’t a backup plan. Jesus wasn’t sent because humanity surprised God with its brokenness. He was “the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world” (Revelation 13:8). Before Adam ever fell, Christ had already risen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world.”<br>
—Ephesians 1:4 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means your life isn’t a series of divine improvisations. It’s a masterpiece unfolding in time, already complete in the mind of God.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-god-who-sees-all-time-at-once" tabindex="-1">The God Who Sees All Time at Once</h2>
<p>We live in a linear world. Past, present, future. One moment after another. But God exists beyond time. He sees the whole timeline at once—like an artist viewing the entire canvas, not just the brushstroke in progress.</p>
<p>That means He sees you not only as you are, but as you will be. He sees the healed version of you. The whole version. The glorified version. And He relates to you from that place.</p>
<p>So when He calls you righteous, even when you feel broken—He’s not lying. He’s speaking from the end of the story.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-weight-of-glory" tabindex="-1">The Weight of Glory</h2>
<p>There’s a holy weight to being known by God. It’s not just that He knows your name—it’s that He knows your purpose. He knows what He placed inside you. He knows what He’s building through you. And He knows how every trial, every delay, every detour is shaping you into the image of His Son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son.”<br>
—Romans 8:29 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not a mystery to God. You are not a disappointment. You are not behind schedule.</p>
<p>You are known. And you are right on time. You are right where you are supposed to be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What would change if you truly believed that God already knows?</p>
<p>Would you worry less? Would you trust more? Would you stop striving to earn what He’s already given?</p>
<p>The God who knows you is not waiting to see how your story ends. He’s already written it. And He’s walking with you through every page.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Father, thank You for knowing me completely. For seeing every part of me—past, present, and future—and loving me still. Help me rest in the truth that I am not hidden from You. That nothing surprises You. That You are not reacting to my life but revealing Your plan through it. Teach me to trust the God who knows. Amen.</p>
