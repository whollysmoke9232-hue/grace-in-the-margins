<p>Soon after I invited Jesus into my life, I expected Him to come in and remodel my house.</p>
<p>It made sense. After all, He built me in the first place—He knew where all the plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and structural strengths and weaknesses were. Who better to do the renovations?</p>
<p>But I soon learned He wasn’t interested in a simple remodel.</p>
<p>He began tearing out walls.<br>
Adding rooms.<br>
Building wings.<br>
Raising new levels.</p>
<p>And then it hit me:</p>
<p>The house He was building wasn’t for me at all.</p>
<p>He was building me into something far greater—<br>
A beautiful, spacious mansion…<br>
Fit for a King.</p>
<p>He is transforming me into “… a temple of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>—1 Corinthians 6:19 (NIV)</p>
