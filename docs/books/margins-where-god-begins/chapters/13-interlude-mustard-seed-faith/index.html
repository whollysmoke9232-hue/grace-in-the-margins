<p>We often talk about miracles as things we witness. But in God’s margins, they’re not only seen—they’re shared. Participation is the miracle. Just ask the disciples on a hillside with five loaves, two fish, and twenty thousand people.</p>
<p>They didn’t just observe the miraculous. Jesus made them a part of it.</p>
<p>This moment is a pivot point in their journey—not just in logistics but in trust. He hands them broken bread, and as they move, the bread regenerates. And then the miracle spreads—from Jesus to disciple, to recipient, to household. The bread continued to regenerate until everyone had enough – even more than enough -- with twelve baskets left to prove God doesn’t do barely enough. He does overflow.</p>
<p>But what happens when the wind picks up?</p>
<p>That’s the tension between faith and fear—between mountain-moving confidence and trembling obedience. Peter understood both. One moment, he’s walking on water; the next, he’s sinking in it. But when Peter’s faith faltered, Jesus caught him. Not to shame him. To remind him. Peter’s “little” faith was enough to empower him to walk on water.</p>
<p>Mustard seed faith isn’t static. It stretches. It walks. It wobbles. And yes—it multiplies.</p>
<p>God invites us into moments where doubt meets action—and action births awe.</p>
<p>You have enough faith. Even if it’s only enough faith to pray for more faith.</p>
<p>God will always reward that prayer.</p>
