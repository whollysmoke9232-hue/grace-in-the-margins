  <!-- Main chapter content -->
  <main class="main-page">
    <p>God doesn’t just know the story—He weaves it.</p>
<p>Every thread. Every color. Every knot. Every frayed edge. He weaves it all into something beautiful, something eternal, something far more intricate than we can see from where we stand.</p>
<p>We live on the underside of the tapestry. From here, it often looks like chaos—loose ends, tangled threads, patterns that don’t make sense. But from above, from the vantage point of eternity, God sees the full design. And He’s never once lost the thread.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="nothing-happens-in-a-vacuum" tabindex="-1">Nothing Happens in a Vacuum</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful realizations I’ve had in my time immersed in Scripture is this: no one in the Bible lived in isolation. No story stands alone. Every person, every event, every encounter is connected to something before it—and something after it.</p>
<p>Take Levi, the tax collector. Luke tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. ‘Follow me,’ Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.”<br>
—Luke 5:27–28 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to read that as a moment in isolation. But Levi had a past. He had parents, teachers, wounds, regrets. He had known joy and sorrow, victory and defeat. He had lived a life that led him to that exact place, on that exact day, in that exact frame of mind—when Jesus walked by and said, “Follow Me.”</p>
<p>And Levi followed.</p>
<p>That moment wasn’t random. It was the result of a thousand unseen threads. And it became a thread that would weave into the lives of others—into the gospel story itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-sycamore-tree" tabindex="-1">The Sycamore Tree</h2>
<p>Think about Zacchaeus. A short man. A curious heart. A tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.”<br>
—Luke 19:4 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that tree didn’t just happen to be there. It had to be planted. It had to grow. It had to be protected from storms and drought and disease. It had to be protected from grazing livestock and marching armies. Long before Zacchaeus ever climbed it, God was preparing it.</p>
<p>That’s how God works. He plants trees decades before we need them. He sets different lives on specific paths so that they will intersect at the perfect time. He sets things in motion long before we realize we’re part of the plan.</p>
<p>Zacchaeus had a divine appointment with Jesus. And he needed a Sycamore tree to keep it. So God appointed a tree.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-thread-of-your-life" tabindex="-1">The Thread of Your Life</h2>
<p>Your life is not a series of disconnected moments. It’s a thread in a divine tapestry. And every joy, every sorrow, every delay, every detour—it’s all being woven into something greater than you can imagine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.”<br>
—Romans 8:28
That verse doesn’t mean everything is good. It means everything is used. Nothing is wasted. Not the pain. Not the waiting. Not the questions. God is weaving it all.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="when-the-pattern-doesnt-make-sense" tabindex="-1">When the Pattern Doesn’t Make Sense</h2>
<p>There are seasons when the thread of your life seems to disappear—when you can’t see how anything fits. But that’s not the end of the story. That’s just the underside of the tapestry.</p>
<p>God is still weaving.</p>
<p>He knows us. He knows that if we could see what He was preparing us for, we would find less painful shortcuts to get there. Which would result in our arriving there unprepared. He loves us too much for that.</p>
<p>One day, whether in this life or the next, you’ll see the full design. You’ll see how every thread mattered. How every moment was connected. How every “why” had a purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What if you believed that nothing in your life was wasted?</p>
<p>What if you trusted that even the tangled threads are part of the design?</p>
<p>You are not lost in the chaos. You are woven into the plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Master Weaver, thank You for holding the thread of my life. Thank You for weaving beauty from brokenness, purpose from pain, and glory from the ordinary. Help me trust You when I can’t see the pattern. Remind me that I am not forgotten—I am woven. Amen.</p>
