<blockquote>
<p><em>“Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”</em><br>
—Matthew 6:34 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Several years ago, my wife and I embarked on an exciting adventure: our first cruise together. The anticipation was electric. We spent nearly a year immersed in the details—poring over the ship's website, studying deck plans, memorizing meal options, and debating shore excursions.</p>
<p>The excitement was so consuming that I downloaded a countdown clock on my phone, checking it countless times a day: “214 days, 7 hours, and 5 minutes until departure!” It was, quite simply, all I could think about.</p>
<p>Finally, the day arrived. After an eight-hour drive to Orlando, we boarded the ship, savored our first meal, enjoyed a spectacular show, and settled into our cabin. As I lay in bed that first night, a sudden realization hit me: the first day of our long-awaited cruise was almost over.</p>
<p>And in what felt like the blink of an eye, the seven days were gone, and we were making the drive back home. It was over—just that fast.</p>
<p>During the ride home, my mind drifted back over the past year. The cruise itself had been amazing, filled with incredible memories that I still cherish. But that year leading up to it? Where had it gone?</p>
<p>I had spent over 300 days fixated on a trip that lasted only seven. In that obsession, I realized I had missed so much of what was happening right in front of me. The previous year, as far as truly meaningful, present-moment memories were concerned, felt a bit like a waste.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-deeper-question" tabindex="-1">A Deeper Question</h2>
<p>This realization sparked a deeper question. How many other times had I been guilty of this same pattern—so focused on some future event, some distant goal, that I inadvertently missed the richness of the present moment?</p>
<p>I was reminded of an interview I once saw with actor Matt Damon. He reflected on winning his Oscar at the young age of twenty-seven and mused on how tragic it would have been to chase that Academy Award for eighty years without ever receiving one. How empty that life would have been—always pursuing the award, rather than fully engaging in each day and genuinely enjoying the journey.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invitation" tabindex="-1">The Invitation</h2>
<p>“Live in the moment,” was the gentle yet profound advice I once received from my counselor. It is an invitation to allow each event, each small experience of every day, to simply be—to enjoy it, to embrace it, to reflect on it, and to learn from it.</p>
<p>When we truly live in the now, the reward is not just a future achievement, but a better version of ourselves today—especially when we invite the Holy Spirit to use every minute of every day to mold us and make us more like Jesus.</p>
<p>The journey itself becomes the prize, shaping us into the people God intends us to be, whether or not the “awards” of life ever come. The true reward is found in His presence, in the unfolding of His grace, and in the blessed gift of each present moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, help me to release my grip on tomorrow and receive today as Your gift. Teach me to recognize Your presence in ordinary moments and to trust that You are at work right here, right now. Shape my heart to rest in You and to walk faithfully in this moment You have given.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>The present moment is not something to endure on the way to something better—it is often where God is doing His deepest work.</p>
