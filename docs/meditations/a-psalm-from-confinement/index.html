<p>Conceived in trouble<br>
Brought forth in pain<br>
Delivered in hope<br>
Reared in faith</p>
<p>Consumed by despair<br>
No comfort found</p>
<p>Life seemed hopeless<br>
But You were there all the time<br>
Where could I turn?<br>
But You were there all the time</p>
<p>How many times, O Lord?<br>
How many times have You shown me<br>
And I closed my eyes<br>
How many times have You called<br>
But I stopped my ears</p>
<p>You’ve surrounded me; You’ve hemmed me in<br>
But I shook You off; I chased my sin<br>
I groped in darkness unable to win<br>
You offered grace again and again</p>
<p>Prayer was lifted<br>
The answer was, “Yes”</p>
<p>Come alive in me</p>
