<blockquote>
<p><em>“Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;<br>
dishonor has covered my face.”</em><br>
—Psalms 69:7</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>O God, this isn’t about me at all.<br>
It is about You.<br>
It has always been about You.<br>
You alone.</p>
<p>How could I think that any of this was for me?<br>
All of this is to bring You glory.</p>
<p>I can’t see the end.<br>
I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.<br>
Men will turn to You.<br>
They will know that You alone are God—<br>
the only God who delivers men from sin.</p>
<p>It is You who rescues,<br>
You who redeems,<br>
You who lifts my soul from the grave.</p>
<p>It is You who has set my feet on a firm foundation.</p>
<p>You are God.<br>
To You I give my life.<br>
To You I offer my worship.<br>
My life is in Your hands.<br>
There is nowhere I would rather be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>O God, I surrender not only my suffering, but my understanding.<br>
I place my life, my pain, and my purpose fully into Your hands.<br>
Be glorified in me, even here.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Suffering becomes worship when it is surrendered to the sovereignty of God.</p>
