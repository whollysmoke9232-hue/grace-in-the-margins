    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God... They have no speech, they use no words; their voice is not heard.&quot;</em><br>
—Psalm 19:1–3</p>

<h2>🌬️ A Morning Encounter</h2>
<p>This morning, as I read Psalm 19—a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship—I found my gaze drifting out my window.<br>
Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward.<br>
A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.</p>
<p>I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork.<br>
How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze.<br>
Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall.<br>
This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.</p>
<p>But then, the scene shifted.<br>
The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently.<br>
It was as though they were waving directly at me.<br>
Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement—or was it a dance?—all seemed to be acknowledging my presence.<br>
As if to say, <em>&quot;We know you're still there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, 'Good morning!'&quot;</em></p>
<p>In that moment, I was utterly overcome.<br>
Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over.<br>
Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father.<br>
And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.</p>
<p>So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees.<br>
It was a holy moment—a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made.<br>
The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:<br>
<strong>You are seen. You are loved.</strong></p>

<h2>🔊 The Unspeakable Voice</h2>
<p>As I reflect on this profound moment, I'm reminded of the Apostle John's struggle to describe the very voice of God in Revelation.<br>
He grasped for human words to convey the divine, offering a series of astonishing comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;...and I heard behind me a loud voice like a <strong>trumpet</strong>”</em> —Revelation 1:10</li>
<li><em>&quot;...and his voice was like the sound of <strong>rushing waters</strong>.”</em> —Revelation 1:15</li>
<li><em>“From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of <strong>thunder</strong>”</em> —Revelation 4:5</li>
<li><em>“And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of <strong>harpists playing their harps</strong>.”</em> —Revelation 14:2</li>
</ul>
<p>We might be justified in asking John, <em>&quot;Okay, John. Which is it? Trumpets? Rushing Waters? Thunder? Harps?&quot;</em><br>
And John’s humble reply would likely be, <em>&quot;Yes. Exactly. I’m so glad you ‘got it.’&quot;</em></p>
<p>Isn’t it amazing that in these quiet, holy moments—when God seems to be whispering into our spirits with a voice that sounds like harps,<br>
or even the silent, waving leaves of a tree—the truth of the message He is planting in our hearts comes in with the force of trumpets, rushing waters, and thunder?</p>
<p>Once again, cementing the truth of His love firmly within our spirits.</p>

<h2>💖 Eternal Message</h2>
<p>Oh, how He loves us.<br>
His voice may be perceived in countless ways,<br>
but its message is always the same:<br>
<strong>You are loved.</strong></p>
