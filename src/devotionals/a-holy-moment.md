## 🌬️ A Morning Encounter

This morning, as I read Psalm 19—a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship—I found my gaze drifting out my window.  
Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward.  
A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.

I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork.  
How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze.  
Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall.  
This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.

But then, the scene shifted.  
The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently.  
It was as though they were waving directly at me.  
Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement—or was it a dance?—all seemed to be acknowledging my presence.  
As if to say, _"We know you're still there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, 'Good morning!'"_

In that moment, I was utterly overcome.  
Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over.  
Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father.  
And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.

So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees.  
It was a holy moment—a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made.  
The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:  
**You are seen. You are loved.**

## 🔊 The Unspeakable Voice

As I reflect on this profound moment, I'm reminded of the Apostle John's struggle to describe the very voice of God in Revelation.  
He grasped for human words to convey the divine, offering a series of astonishing comparisons:

- _"...and I heard behind me a loud voice like a **trumpet**”_ —Revelation 1:10
- _"...and his voice was like the sound of **rushing waters**.”_ —Revelation 1:15
- _“From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of **thunder**”_ —Revelation 4:5
- _“And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of **harpists playing their harps**.”_ —Revelation 14:2

We might be justified in asking John, _"Okay, John. Which is it? Trumpets? Rushing Waters? Thunder? Harps?"_  
And John’s humble reply would likely be, _"Yes. Exactly. I’m so glad you ‘got it.’"_

Isn’t it amazing that in these quiet, holy moments—when God seems to be whispering into our spirits with a voice that sounds like harps,  
or even the silent, waving leaves of a tree—the truth of the message He is planting in our hearts comes in with the force of trumpets, rushing waters, and thunder?

Once again, cementing the truth of His love firmly within our spirits.
