# Roadblocks: Getting Out of Our Own Way

Why is it so hard to get out of our own way?

If a runaway dump truck were barreling toward us, every fiber of our being would scream, _"Get out of the way!"_ And we would.  
If we knew a meteorite was heading for our location, we'd scramble to safety.  
If someone intended us harm, we'd instinctively flee.

These are situations where our natural "fight or flight" response kicks in, driving us to preserve ourselves.

But what about when something **good** is coming our way?

It seems that the biggest roadblock to receiving all that God desires for us is often… _us_.  
Read that again: we can be the **biggest obstacle to God's blessings** in our lives.

I'm reminded of a "Preacher's Story" I heard years ago:

> A certain man died and went to heaven. Upon arrival, he was met by Jesus, who immediately began to show him around.  
> He saw all his family who had arrived before him. He was introduced to heroes from the Bible and the early Church.  
> Jesus showed him the streets of gold, the tree of life, the Ark of the Covenant, and even the mansion that had been built for him since before time began.
>
> In time, the man noticed a street Jesus seemed to be avoiding, so he asked to see it.  
> As they walked down that street, he saw row after row of warehouses.  
> They came upon one that bore his name. Jesus opened the door to reveal countless riches and blessings.  
> "What is all this?" the man asked, astonished.
>
> Jesus replied, _"These are all the things I wanted to give you, but couldn’t, because you were too busy chasing other 'things.'"_

This powerful story echoes Jesus' words in the Parable of the Sower:

> “Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.”  
> — Mark 4:18–19

Keep in mind: the “other things” aren’t bad in and of themselves.  
They are just **not Him**.

The only thing that can truly **limit the Holy Spirit’s effectiveness** in our lives is ourselves.

God wants to **change us. Re-create us. Make us “new” beings** (Revelation 21:5).  
He is not interested in making us “better.”  
He is about the business of making us **new**—who we were created to be, not just a better version of who we are.

So, how long will we continue to get in His way?  
How long will we keep chasing "other things"?

Sometimes, these "other things" even seem like good pursuits—like diligent Bible study, dedicated community service, or creative endeavors such as writing.  
Yet, anything not primarily motivated by seeking Him first becomes an "other thing" (Matthew 6:33).  
Our focus shifts from the **Giver** to the gifts, from **His plan** to our pursuits.

Will you join me in drawing a line in the sand and declaring:

> _"Enough is enough! I'm tired of trying the same thing over and over, while expecting a different outcome."_

If you want something you've never had,  
You must be willing to do something you've never done.

**I’m giving up. I surrender. I want God's best for me—whatever that is.**  
And to receive it, I'm going to **get out of the way**.

## 🙏 Prayer

**Lord,**  
Pull up the thorns.  
Unmask the subtle distractions.  
Help me hear Your voice freshly and bear fruit that lasts.  
I don’t want growth—I want **You**.
