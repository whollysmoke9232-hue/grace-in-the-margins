## ✨ Devotional: God Works, So We Work

There’s a beautiful mystery in the Christian life:  
We are called to work—yet we are not alone in the work.  
We are called to obey—yet even our obedience is fueled by grace.

Paul’s words in Philippians 2 remind us that sanctification is not passive.  
We don’t drift into holiness.  
We pursue it.  
We “work out” our salvation—not to earn it, but to express it.  
This is our responsibility: to actively seek obedience, to grow in grace, to become more like Christ.

But here’s the good news:  
We don’t do it in our own strength.

> “For it is God who works in you…”

He is the One who stirs our hearts, who shapes our desires, who empowers our actions.  
He gives us both the will and the ability to do what pleases Him.

## 🔍 Work Out, Not Work For

Notice Paul doesn’t say “work _for_ your salvation.”  
He says “work _out_.”

Like a seed that grows into a tree, salvation planted in us by grace must be cultivated.

- We water it with prayer.
- We nourish it with the Word.
- We prune it with repentance.
- And God gives the growth.

## 🎯 For His Good Pleasure

Why do we do this?  
Not for applause.  
Not for approval.  
But for **His pleasure**.

God delights in our obedience—not because He needs it, but because it reflects His own work in us.  
When we walk in His will, we bring joy to His heart.

## 🙏 Prayer

_Father, thank You for working in me.  
Thank You for giving me both the desire and the strength to follow You.  
Help me to take my walk with You seriously—to pursue holiness with reverence and joy.  
Let my life be a reflection of Your grace at work in me.  
May everything I do bring pleasure to Your heart. Amen._
