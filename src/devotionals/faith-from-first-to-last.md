## Faith from First to Last

**Key Scripture:**

> "For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed ‚Äîa righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ‚ÄúThe righteous will live by faith.‚Äù ‚ÄìRomans 1:17

Have you ever felt the weight of trying to be "good enough"? The relentless striving, the constant measuring, the nagging feeling that you always fall short? The good news of the Gospel cuts through all of that striving with a profound truth: the righteousness of God is not something we earn; it's something He **reveals** and **credits** to our account. A divine deposit into the account of the undeserving. That‚Äôs the miracle of Romans 1 and the echo of Genesis 15:6. Abraham believed‚Ä¶ and it was credited to him as righteousness.

As Romans 1:17 beautifully puts it, this is "a righteousness that is by faith from first to last." There is absolutely nothing we can do, no good deed, no amount of effort, to earn this perfect righteousness. It is freely given to us, credited to us by faith, just as it was to Abraham (Genesis 15:6).

At the moment of our salvation, what do we bring to the table? Only our faith. We surrender our attempts to earn, and we simply trust in His finished work.

But faith isn't just the entry point; it's the entire journey.  
**Faith is also the goal of our life after salvation.**

We walk by faith.  
We grow by faith.  
We are conformed to the image of Christ by faith.

As we walk with Christ, our lives are gradually transformed into His image. This transformation isn't fueled by our own striving, but by an ongoing, active faith. It's as we apply what He reveals to us through our study of His Word, through prayer, and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that our character begins to reflect His.

And here's another humbling, yet liberating, truth: even faith itself is a gift from the Holy Spirit. It's not something we conjure up on our own, but a divine enablement that allows us to receive all that God has for us.

So, let go of the burden of earning. Embrace the freedom of receiving. From the moment we first believe to the very end of our journey, it is all by faith ‚Äì a gift that empowers us to live a righteous life, not _for_ salvation, but _from_ salvation.

## Reflection Questions

1. What does it mean to you that God's righteousness is "credited" to your account, rather than earned?
2. How does understanding faith as both the beginning and the ongoing goal of your spiritual life change your perspective on daily challenges or temptations?
3. Take a moment to thank God for the gift of faith and for the righteousness He has freely given you.
