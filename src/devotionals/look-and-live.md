## Devotional: Just Look and Live

In the wilderness, the Israelites were dying—bitten by serpents, the consequence of their rebellion.  
But God, in His mercy, provided a way of healing: a bronze serpent lifted high on a pole.  
There was no ritual, no sacrifice, no work required.  
Just one thing: **look.**  
And **live.**

That moment in Israel’s history was more than a rescue—it was a foreshadowing.  
Jesus pointed back to it when He said, _“Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”_  
Just as the bronze serpent was raised for healing, Christ would be lifted on the cross for our salvation.

And the invitation remains the same:

- Not “work harder.”
- Not “clean yourself up.”
- Not “prove you’re worthy.”  
  Just… **look.**  
  Look to Jesus.  
  Believe.  
  And live.

## Reflection

We often complicate grace.  
We try to earn what can only be received.  
But the gospel is stunning in its simplicity:

> _“For God so loved the world…”_

That includes you.  
That includes your mess, your doubts, your failures.

He gave His only Son—not to condemn you, but to save you.

Jesus is the Judge, yes.  
But He didn’t come to slam the gavel—He came to open the door.  
The judgment isn’t in His coming; it’s in our response.  
The Light has come.  
Will we turn toward it… or away?

## Prayer

_Lord Jesus, thank You for being lifted up for me.  
I confess that I often try to earn what You’ve already given.  
Help me to simply look to You in faith.  
Thank You for loving me before I ever loved You.  
Today, I choose to believe.  
I choose to live._  
**Amen.**

## Takeaway Thought

You don’t have to climb your way to God.  
You don’t have to fix yourself first.  
You just have to look.  
**Look to Jesus.**  
And **live.**
