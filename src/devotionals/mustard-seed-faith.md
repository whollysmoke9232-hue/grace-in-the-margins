## Devotional: Mustard Seed Faith

I used to think that verse was good news…  
If I ever needed to move a mountain.

But then I began to notice the kind of faith so many displayed when Jesus walked among them—faith that wasn’t flashy or loud, but persistent, expectant, and deeply rooted:

- The woman with the issue of blood _(Luke 8:43)_
- The lame man at the Pool of Bethesda _(John 5:1)_
- The paralytic lowered through the roof _(Mark 2:3)_
- The groom at Cana _(John 2:1)_
- The grieving mother in Nain _(Luke 7:11)_
- The man with a withered hand _(Mark 3:1)_

And then—perhaps most remarkably—the miracle of multiplication in _Matthew 14:15–33_.  
Five loaves. Two fish. 20,000 hungry people.  
And twelve disciples who had no idea that today, they’d be part of the miracle.

Jesus blessed the bread. Broke it. Handed a piece to the first disciple…  
Yet somehow, both the disciple and Jesus were holding full loaves.  
It continued with each disciple—and then with each recipient.

Not only did they _see_ the miracle…  
They _took part_ in it.

Then, as if to seal the moment, Jesus had each disciple collect a basket overflowing with leftovers—tangible evidence of faith meeting divine abundance.

## Faith in the Storm

But just hours later, fear returned.  
In the boat, the disciples trembled as Jesus walked toward them on the water.

Peter dared to believe—mustard seed faith—and for a moment, he walked on water.  
But doubt crept in when he focused more on the wind than the Savior.

When Peter began to sink, Jesus caught him immediately.

> _“O you of little faith…”_

His words weren’t a rebuke.  
They were a reminder:  
**Even little faith is powerful when pointed toward Me.**

## Prayer Reflection

_Lord, help us not despise the days of small faith.  
Thank You for catching us when we sink.  
Remind us that mustard seed faith is more than enough in Your hands.  
Teach us to fix our eyes on You—through storms, through wonder—and trust that You’ll never let us fall._  
**Amen.**
