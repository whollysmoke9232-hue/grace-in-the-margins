excerpt: Worship isn’t just a song—it’s surrender. Like Enoch, may we walk so closely with God that heaven becomes the natural next step.

## The Broken Beginning

In 1999, we didn’t plan revival. We didn’t schedule an awakening.  
We just reached the end of ourselves—and God showed up.

Our church had lost its leaders and direction, but in that vacuum of certainty, the Spirit stirred something deep.

- Prayer became our oxygen.
- Worship became our warfare.

And one Sunday, heaven breached the ordinary.

People flooded the altar. They wept, collapsed, cried out.  
Salvation came—not just in services, but in the foyer, in the parking lot.  
Miracles unfolded. Healings. Marriages restored. Callings ignited.

And as the Worship Leader, I saw it.

Literally.  
I saw the Spirit sweep across the room.  
I saw the wave that dropped people to their knees.  
I saw the Glory Cloud.  
And once—I saw the battlefield. Angels engaged in warfare.  
I wasn’t fighting…I was feeding them.  
With praise. With worship. With intercession.

> Our intensity fueled their victory.  
> Their victory ignited ours.

## The Cost of Praise

Isaiah said, _“Woe is me...I am undone.”_  
And that’s how I felt.  
Undone by the power.  
Exposed by my pride.

Loving God meant giving Him _everything_—heart, soul, mind, and strength.  
And that kind of love costs something.

As David said:

> _“I will not offer to the Lord that which costs me nothing.”_

For me, the price is pride.  
To truly worship, I must be seen—not as balanced, but as broken.  
Not polished, but present.  
I must die to image and awaken to intimacy.

## Legacy Through Worship

Wayne Watson once sang:

> _“I want to get so close to Him that it’s no big change on that day when Jesus calls my name.”_

Enoch knew what that meant.  
Worship led him closer and closer…until heaven simply folded him in.

His intimacy left a legacy—one that reached Noah, whose faith helped save mankind.

> What if our worship today fuels victories for generations to come?  
> What if our surrender becomes their sanctuary?

## Prayer

_Lord, I want to love You with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength.  
Kill my pride.  
Strip away my self-awareness.  
Make me childlike again.  
Let my worship empower the angelic battle for the lost, the hurting, the bound.  
Make me a conduit.  
Let me dance like Enoch danced—until I’m so close to You, I don’t even notice when heaven takes me home._  
**Amen.**
