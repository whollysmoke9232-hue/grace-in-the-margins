# Starved or Fed?

_Devotional Reflection by Steve Wilkins_

We ask:

- What's God's will for my life?
- Who should I marry?
- What's my calling?
- What's God saying to me about this crisis, this friend, this ache in my marriage?

And yet, with all the desperation for answers, we so often neglect the clearest Voice we've been given: the Word of God.

We search:

- A song that moved us
- A sermon that stirred something
- A conversation with a mentor

These may carry glimpses of truth, echoes of God's heart. But if King Jesus is who we long to hear from, why aren't we looking directly in His Word?

Ask yourself:

Do I believe the Bible is God-breathed? Alive? Sharp?
Not just a book of suggestions…
But the blueprint for every breath, every burden, every breakthrough?

Here's the hard question:
Can you quote one Scripture from memory for every year you've walked with Jesus?
Not as a rule, but as a measure of where you've built your spiritual vocabulary.

We celebrate the idea of the Bible in the Church.
We'll even fight for the _right_ to own one…
...and then leave it untouched in a closet.

We're not being punished.
We're not condemned.
You are _as righteous and holy as you'll ever need to be_, by the finished work of Jesus.

But let's be honest:
There's something wrong if nothing feels wrong about neglecting God's Word.

We study all the time.

- Sports stats
- Headlines
- Music trivia
- Investment strategies

We're students by nature.
The deeper question is: _What are we students of?_

## What do you long to have revealed to you each day?

Let Psalm 119:9–16 reorient your appetite:

_How can a young man keep his way pure?_

_By guarding it according to your word._

_With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander…_

_I have stored up your word in my heart,_

_that I might not sin against you._

The Word of God is not a side dish. It's your daily bread.
Open it. Eat. Marinate in its mystery.

The wonderful thing about Bible Study is this:
You don't need commentary, credentials, or clarity—just the Bible, and a willing heart.
