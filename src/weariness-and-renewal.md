## Weariness and Renewal

There is a weariness that settles into the bones—not mere tiredness, but a deep fatigue of spirit that comes from long seasons of struggle, from bearing what feels unbearable, from the slow erosion of hope. Yet there is also renewal. Not the kind that denies the weariness, but the kind that meets us in it.

This collection explores the valley of exhaustion and the quiet, persistent grace that whispers of rest, refreshment, and the strength to take one more step when we have nothing left to give.
