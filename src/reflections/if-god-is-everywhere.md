# If God Is Everywhere All The Time…

If God is everywhere,
then I do not merely walk with Him—
I exist within Him.
I breathe in His presence,
and He breathes through mine.

If God is everywhere,
then "as far as the east is from the west"
is still within His embrace.
There is no exile from His love,
no distance from His gaze.

If God is everywhere,
then He sees me as I am,
as I was,
and as I will be—
all at once.
Not in sequence, but in fullness.
Not in progress, but in completion.

If God is everywhere,
then He knows everything that can be known about me—
and infinitely more.
The things I hide,
the things I fear,
the things I don't yet understand about myself—
He holds them all without flinching.

If God is everywhere,
then what I call an obstacle
is both there and not there.
It is real in my time,
but resolved in His.
It is a shadow cast by a light I haven't yet seen.

If God is everywhere,
then He is not "working on me."
He has already finished.
I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.

If God is everywhere,
then all of my current and future problems
have already been solved.
All of my questions
already answered.
I am not waiting for clarity—
I am walking toward it.

If God is everywhere,
then maybe when I get to Heaven,
I'll realize I've been there all along.
That eternity was never a destination,
but a dimension I was always tethered to.

If God is everywhere,
then even my sins and weaknesses
will become stained-glass windows—
broken pieces made beautiful
by the light of His grace.

If God is everywhere,
then the power that created galaxies
and raised Jesus from the grave
dwells in me.
Not metaphorically.
Literally.

If God is everywhere,
then I am connected to everything—
because everything exists within Him.
Every atom, every angel,
every moment, every miracle.

If God is everywhere,
then nothing is impossible for me.
Because nothing is impossible for Him.
And He is not just beside me—
He is in me.
And I am in Him.
