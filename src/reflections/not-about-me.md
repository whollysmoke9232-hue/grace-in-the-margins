## 🧎‍♂️ A Meditation in Suffering

_O God, this isn’t about me at all;_  
_It is about You._  
_It has always been about You._  
_You alone._

_How could I think that any of this was for me?_  
_All of this is to bring You glory._

_I can’t see the end._  
_I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up._  
_Men will turn to You._  
_They will know that You alone are God;_  
_The only God who delivers men from Sin._

_It is You who rescues,_  
_You who redeems,_  
_You who lifts my soul from the grave._  
_It is You who has set my feet on a firm foundation._

_You are God._  
_To You I give my life._  
_To You I offer my worship._  
_My life is in Your hands._  
_There is nowhere I would rather be._

## 🙏 Reflection

This meditation is a surrender—not to suffering, but to the sovereignty of God.  
It’s a declaration that even pain has purpose when it brings Him glory.  
It’s a reminder that redemption is not just a rescue—it’s a revelation of who God is.
