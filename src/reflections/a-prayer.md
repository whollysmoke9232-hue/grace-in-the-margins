## A Prayer

O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.

I've seen Your hand.

I've experienced a taste of Your love.

I've been given a glimpse of Your glory.

But I want to see more of You.

Purify my heart.

Cleanse me.

Reveal my sin.

Burn away my chaff.

I desire a deep cleansing.

Create in me a clean heart – a new heart

So that all that is left standing in me is You.

I don't want to remember my sin.

I don't want to long for sinful things.

I seek You.

I seek Your will – Your perfect will.

Fix my mind in innocence,

My imagination in purity.

Lead me in truth.

Steady me with Your hand.

You are all I need.

You are all I want.

O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.
