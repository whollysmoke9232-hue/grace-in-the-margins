A quiet place for those struggling with pornography or sexual compulsion—written from lived experience, not formulas or fixes.
</div>

If you’re here, it’s likely because pornography or sexual compulsion has been part of your story—maybe quietly, maybe painfully, maybe longer than you ever intended. You may not know exactly what you believe about it yet, or even whether you want to change. You may feel conflicted, ashamed, numb, exhausted, or simply tired of carrying this alone. This page exists for one reason only: to let you know you’re not alone here, and that there is room to breathe, to be honest, and to take things one step at a time.
