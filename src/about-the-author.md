## Get to Know the Author

Grace in the Margins was born from a life lived in small moments—ordinary encounters, quiet struggles, and the recurring discovery that God's presence is most palpable when we are most aware of our own smallness.

These writings are not offered as answers, but as witness. They come from a life devoted to paying attention, to finding meaning in the margins, to believing that the small matters because the small is where most of us actually live.
