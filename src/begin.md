## Begin

These writings were never created to fulfill a plan or advance an agenda.

Each piece was written in response to something lived, observed, read, or endured — often without any thought of where it might belong later. Over time, themes began to emerge, and the collections you see here were formed organically, after the fact.

This library is offered as it is, not as instruction, but as witness — in the hope that others might find encouragement, strength, or the quiet resolve to endure.
