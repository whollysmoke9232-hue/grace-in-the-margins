      <blockquote>
<p><em>“O LORD, You have searched me and known me.” — Psalms 139:1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The First Hook</h2>
<p>It all started innocently enough. I was too young to know what I was doing. I was curious. She was curious. Neither of us even knew what “sex” was. We just wanted to look. To discover. So we looked. We touched. We explored.</p>
<p>And that’s where it started. That’s when Satan learned what bait would keep me coming back for more. I was only nine years old. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was hooked.</p>
<p>My mother worked for the church, so I have been in church since I was an infant. The church tradition I was raised in placed a high priority on teaching what the Bible says. From an early age, I’ve known the difference between right and wrong. I knew, for instance, that what I was doing with my friend was wrong—I just wasn’t sure why or what part of it was wrong. I just knew that I didn’t want to get caught.</p>
<p>A few years later, when I was eleven, my family moved to a different state and our visits were reduced to just a couple each year. As we grew older, our “exploring” stopped. We eventually grew apart.</p>
<p>But my journey continued.</p>
<p>Shortly after moving into our new house, I discovered that rubbing myself on the bed sheets felt good. I did it often. One day, there was an emission. It scared me. I thought I had done something wrong. But it also introduced a new kind of pleasure. Satan sank his hook a little deeper.</p>
<p>That summer, at camp, I was raped multiple times by an adult leader. I don’t recall having thought much about sex until then. But this was my formal introduction. I didn’t know it at the time, but my life would be changed forever.</p>
<p>Later that summer, I discovered men's magazines. I found that looking at the images they contained increased the pleasure of the sheets. I couldn’t get enough.</p>
<p>Fantasy and masturbation (or “acting out”) wound up being a trend that would follow me for the next five decades—as Satan set his hook deeper and deeper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.” — James 1:14-15</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Spiral Tightens</h2>
<p>Adolescence didn’t slow the spiral—it accelerated it.</p>
<p>By the time I reached high school, daily acting out had become a regular part of my life. Fantasies fueled by stories, magazines, and memories kept me hungry to take the next step. It didn’t take long. I soon discovered that there were plenty of girls at my school who were just as eager to explore and experiment as I was.</p>
<p>It started slowly: go steady with a girl and see how far I could go. After she had had enough, I would move on. That’s when my “Death Spiral” began.</p>
<p>I would spend time with a girl and do whatever she would let me do, then I would go home and act out while fantasizing about going further. When I was “finished,” guilt and shame would consume me. I cried out for forgiveness and committed to never do it again. But the next opportunity that came along—I did do it again. Same process. Same spiral.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found a girl willing to go all the way. So we did. And even that led to more fantasy and acting out. Then came the guilt and shame. Prayer and commitment. And Satan set the hook even deeper.</p>
<p>Fear of pregnancy. Fear of getting caught. Conviction of sin. None of it could break the grip.</p>
<p>We finally broke up—and so did my heart. But I didn’t grieve with stillness. I soothed the pain by jumping back into the spiral. Another girl. Then another. And on and on it went.</p>
<p>High School brought another change in my life – an intensely spiritual one. Something started stirring within me. A desire to live a life that was pleasing to my Heavenly Father. I started reading my Bible. I became a leader in my church youth group. I began to experience a new closeness to God. This shined a blinding light into my sexual darkness. I was convicted by my sin. I knew that God was not pleased by the way I treated the girls in my life. I knew that something had to change. I clung to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” — Matthew 6:33</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Seek first His kingdom…” I pressed hard into that quest, trusting that in the end, God’s will would prevail. This was the beginning of the spiritual struggle that would accompany the next fifty years.</p>
<p>This cycle took its toll. Friendships slipped away. “Nice” girls either saw through me or knew to steer clear. I found that I couldn’t simply admire a girl—I had stopped seeing her as someone with a soul. I had come to see girls as a collection of parts for my pleasure. I didn’t need a relationship; she just had to be willing.</p>
<p>By graduation, I was in a full-on tailspin. I didn’t know it yet. But God did.</p>
<h2>At the Altar</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.” — Romans 5:6</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came the Keith Green concert.</p>
<p>There wasn’t an altar call that I remember. No persuasive speech or emotional invitation. But something deep stirred. In the middle of his performance, I found myself standing at the stage—overcome with conviction. I realized in that moment that I had been playing games with God. And He wasn’t amused.</p>
<p>That night, everything changed. I received forgiveness and new life. As I stood there in awe, I prayed: “Father, I don’t want to be interested in any other girl until I meet the one I will marry.” And I wasn’t.</p>
<p>The weeks that followed were electric. Bible studies. Worship gatherings. Mid-week church services. New friends—godly friends. No drugs. No sex. Just transformation. I was living in light for the first time.</p>
<p>Then I saw her.</p>
<p>She was the answer to my prayer. I was twenty, and from the moment we met, I knew. She made me want to be a better Christian. A better man. We spent a great deal of our time together at church. We courted. And it was beautiful.</p>
<p>But before long, the old urges crept back.</p>
<p>I began fantasizing about her—then acting out those fantasies, followed by acting out in private, guilt, shame, prayer, and recommitment. The spiral had returned. Familiar. Unforgiving.</p>
<p>We both knew our behavior was sinful. We talked. We tried to stop. But I couldn’t.</p>
<p>Years later, I discovered how addiction had altered the structure of my brain. Repeated indulgence changed dopamine balances—diminishing pleasure and driving me to seek darker expressions.</p>
<p>I returned to magazines. More diverse. More extreme. It wasn’t just physical or psychological. It was spiritual. As Jesus said in <em>John 8:34: “...everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.”</em> That was me.</p>
<p>The addiction spread like mold. It warped my relationships, my identity, my sense of reality. I convinced myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The answer was marriage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intimacy would heal me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love would override lust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>The shame I carried made intimacy with my new wife almost impossible. It affected her sense of self—her worth, her sanity. I could see it. I could feel it. And I hated myself for it. But I still couldn’t change it.</p>
<p>So I did the only thing I knew: I dove deeper into my addiction.</p>
<p>The spiral intensified.</p>
<p><strong>Sobriety and the Shaking Ground</strong></p>
<p>May 1, 2018 marked the beginning of recovery.</p>
<p>Three Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) meetings a week. Monthly counseling. New tools. New language. A new life I had never known—free from addiction. In SA, we call it “sobriety.”</p>
<p>And sobriety was exhilarating.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I had time. Time with my wife. Time with my children. We laughed more. Talked more. I noticed the difference, and so did they. I felt unstoppable.</p>
<p>But before long I got cocky. My initial sobriety seemed to come so easily.</p>
<p>Gradually, I stopped everything. No more meetings. No more counseling.</p>
<p>At first, I held the line. Months would pass without relapse. And each time I slipped, I would fight back. The teachings from SA helped me recover after every fall. For years, I was “doing okay.” The spirals never returned with full force. And I convinced myself I was in control.</p>
<p>But something was shifting.</p>
<p>By November 2022, my world began to unravel.</p>
<p>It started with my body. A mysterious cough. A foul, persistent taste. Sudden weight loss. A thirst I couldn’t quench. A need to urinate every 15 to 20 minutes—day and night. My mouth became dry to the point of pain, and eating was no longer enjoyable. Constipation added discomfort. Fatigue followed.</p>
<p>My job added stress. I drove a special needs school bus—a role I once found meaningful. But now I was alone most of the time. When I wasn’t alone, I was transporting non-verbal pre-schoolers in silence. My mornings began with a 4:00 AM alarm, ruling out social life or evening ministry. I felt invisible.</p>
<p>What’s worse: my financial anxiety skyrocketed.</p>
<p>In June 2020, I began receiving Social Security benefits. I’d returned to work hoping to stay beneath the income threshold—but overtime threatened that plan. The pressure to confront my supervisor weighed heavily.</p>
<p>Social withdrawal was almost complete. Since 2018, I had focused solely on my family, desperate to repair what my addiction had damaged. But the cost of that tunnel vision was steep: I had no close friends to talk to. No outlet. No lifeline.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed. Afraid. Alone.</p>
<p>So I returned to the only coping mechanism I knew.</p>
<p><strong>Broken and Arrested</strong></p>
<p><em>“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” --1 Peter 5:8</em></p>
<p>When my health collapsed, when my job strained me to the edge, when isolation screamed louder than hope—I made a desperate choice.</p>
<p>I returned to my addiction.</p>
<p>It wasn't casual. It was compulsive. Desperate. Multiple times a day, hidden from my family, buried under guilt. I had promised not to alienate them again. So, I moved the habit out of my home… and onto my school bus.</p>
<p>It felt safe. Solitary. Concealed.</p>
<p>But the spiral had grown tighter.</p>
<p>One afternoon, while acting out during a layover with sleeping students on board, a parent approached my bus. I scrambled. Hid the screen. Covered myself. But I knew—I had been discovered. Like an addict, my panic didn’t stop me. I finished the routine minutes later.</p>
<p>Days later, I was terminated.</p>
<p><em>“Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.” James 5:16</em></p>
<p>The day after, I confided in a trusted friend. It was the first time I admitted the full scope of my addiction. He committed to walk with me and hold me accountable. We prayed together. We agreed to meet weekly for encouragement, confession, and prayer. He recommended internet monitoring software. I installed it that same day: February 23, 2023. That marked the beginning of my current sobriety.</p>
<p>Four days later, I was arrested.</p>
<p>Charged with four counts of Indecent Exposure and Child Molestation. As I read the charges, it felt as if my life was ebbing away. I knew that I hadn’t exposed myself to anyone and I hadn’t touched a child. But the charges stuck.</p>
<p>Twenty-two months in jail. Waiting. Wondering. Wrestling.</p>
<p>In May of that year, my wife asked for a divorce. It was finalized in September.</p>
<p>I was released on bond in December 2024. I’m still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>While inside, I turned to words—and the Word. Twelve to fourteen hours a day, I read – every Christian book I could get my hands on. But one book kept drawing me back: my Bible. Fourteen times through it. Front to back. My daily prayer:</p>
<p>“God, write Your Word in my heart and make me a different man than the one who entered this jail in 2023.”</p>
<p>I believe He did.</p>
<p>Now out, I face crushing uncertainty: no job prospects, undrivable car, looming homelessness. My family seems distant. Most friends have left. Yet one truth remains:</p>
<p><strong><em>“…this I know, that God is for me.” -Psalms 56:9</em></strong></p>
<p>He has not abandoned me. He walks with me—through shame, through accusation, through loss and uncertainty. And wherever He leads, I will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Still Standing</strong></p>
<p>Life outside jail isn’t the relief I expected. It has its own battlefield.</p>
<p>I can’t get a job—either because of the charges hanging over me or my age. Gig work is out. My car’s transmission gave out, leaving me stuck. I can’t deliver packages. I can’t drive to interviews. I can’t sleep in the car because it no longer runs.</p>
<p>Homelessness looms.</p>
<p>Most of my family have distanced themselves. Old friends remain silent. Ministry connections have faded. I am back in the world—but without a place in it.</p>
<p>And yet, God remains near.</p>
<p><em>“…for He Himself has said, ‘I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,’” --Hebrews 13:5</em></p>
<p>The man who walked into jail in 2023 had been buried in shame. The man who walked out has been resurrected through the Word. Fourteen times through the Bible. Fourteen layers peeled away. Fourteen encounters with grace. And I’m still reading. My love for His Word has not faded.</p>
<p>I now understand addiction differently—not just as sin or weakness, but as spiritual slavery. And what Jesus said in <em>John 8:36</em> is true: <em>“If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”</em></p>
<p>Freedom doesn’t mean ease. It means clarity. Sobriety doesn’t guarantee comfort. It guarantees war—and the Spirit’s presence within it. Like the three friends thrown into the fiery furnace, I am not alone <em>(Daniel 3: 16-28).</em></p>
<p>I still face trial. I could spend the rest of my life in prison. From the world’s view, I am wrecked, discarded, a cautionary tale. But from heaven’s view, I’m redeemed.</p>
<p>God hasn’t forsaken me. I feel Him in the hunger. I hear Him in the silence. I see Him in the uncertainty.</p>
<p>And wherever He leads—without promise or certainty—I will follow, because,</p>
<p><em>“Whom have I in heaven but You?
And besides You, I desire nothing on earth.
My flesh and my heart may fail,
But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”</em></p>
<p><em>-Psalms 73:25-26</em></p>
<p><strong>Margins</strong></p>
<p>I never set out to write this story.</p>
<p>I lived it. I survived it. I lost almost everything to it. But by grace, I’m still here—and God is still speaking.</p>
<p>This isn’t a tale of triumph tied in a bow. It’s a testimony. A slow emergence from years of entrapment, shame, and silence. I am a man changed—not just by meetings or prison or consequences—but by the relentless, pursuing love of God.</p>
<p>For decades, I lived in the margins of society. The margins of church. The margins of my own mind. Addiction made sure of that. Guilt made it worse. And isolation cemented the lie that God had moved on.</p>
<p>But He hadn't.</p>
<p>I met Him in church. I met Him at a concert. I met Him in relationships. I met Him in jail. I met Him in scripture. I met Him in the silence. I met Him in the flicker of hope that said, “Write this down. Someone needs it.”</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>While in jail, I wrote:</p>
<p><strong><em>“A Holy Moment</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God... They have no speech, they use no words; their voice is not heard.&quot; –Psalm 19:1-3</em></p>
<p><em>“This morning, as I read Psalm 19, a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship, I found my gaze drifting out my window. Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward. A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.</em></p>
<p><em>“I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork. How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze. Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall. This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.</em></p>
<p><em>“But then, the scene shifted. The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently. It was as though they were waving directly at me. Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement – or was it a dance? – all seemed to be acknowledging my presence. As if to say, &quot;We know you're still in there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, 'Good morning!'&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>“In that moment, I was utterly overcome. Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over. Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father. And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.</em></p>
<p><em>“So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees. It was a holy moment, a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made. The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:</em> <strong><em>You are seen.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You are loved.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“As I reflect on this profound moment, I'm reminded of the Apostle John's struggle to describe the very voice of God in his book of Revelation. He grasped for human words to convey the divine, offering a series of astonishing comparisons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>“...and I heard behind me a loud voice like a</em> <strong>*trumpet**</strong>” (Revelation 1:10)*</li>
<li><em>“...and his voice was like the sound of</em> <strong>*rushing waters**</strong>.” (Revelation 1:15)*</li>
<li><em>“From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of</em> <strong>*thunder**</strong>” (Revelation 4:5)*</li>
<li><em>“And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of</em> <strong>*harpists playing their harps**</strong>.” (Revelation 14:2)*</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“We might be justified in asking John, &quot;Okay, John. Which is it? Trumpets? Rushing Waters? Thunder? Harps?&quot; And John’s humble reply would likely be, &quot;Yes. Exactly. I’m so glad you ‘got it.'&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>“Isn’t it amazing that in these quiet, holy moments – when God seems to be whispering into our spirits with a voice that sounds like harps, or even the silent, waving leaves of a tree – the truth of the message He is planting in our hearts comes in with the force of trumpets, rushing waters, and thunder? Once again, cementing the truth of His love firmly within our spirits.</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh, how He loves us. His voice may be perceived in countless ways, but its message is always the same:</em> <strong><em>You are loved.”</em></strong></p>
<p>If you’re reading this and feel like you’ve gone too far... you haven’t.</p>
<p>If your secrets scream louder than your prayers... He hears you.</p>
<p>If you think redemption is only for the “clean” or the “worthy”... let my life remind you otherwise.</p>
<p><em>The blood of Christ was sufficient to pay the penalty for every lie you ever told or will tell, every sin you ever committed or will commit, every person you ever hurt or will hurt, every lustful thought or action you’ve ever had or will have, every greedy or angry thought you’ve ever had or will have, and every betrayal you ever perpetrated or will perpetrate. It’s not just your past that has been legally covered; it’s your present and future. When Jesus said on the cross, “It is finished,” it was finished… all of it.</em></p>
<p><em>(Taken from, Hidden Agendas, by Steve Brown)</em></p>
<p>God does His best work in margins. Where reputation crumbles, where labels stick, where no one else wants to go—that’s where God builds altars.</p>
<p>And that’s where He found me.</p>
<p>So I will keep reading. I will keep writing. I will keep walking. I will keep waving back to the trees. Because every breath I take now echoes the mercy of a God who refused to leave me behind while I was living in the margins.</p>
<p>Margins aren’t where the story ends.</p>
<p>Margins are where resurrection begins.</p>
