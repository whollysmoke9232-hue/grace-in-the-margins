  <h2>Grace in the Margins</h2>
  <p>
    This space was born from a deep conviction: that God is not absent in life’s interruptions, but profoundly present. 
    Whether in silence, suffering, or unexpected detours, His sovereignty weaves redemption into every story.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Grace in the Margins</strong> is a place to explore that truth — through devotionals, reflections, and testimonies that 
    speak to the quiet ways God moves. It’s a creative and theological journey shaped by scripture, storytelling, and the belief 
    that no moment is wasted in His hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, you’ll find encouragement to see your life through the lens of eternity, and to trust that even in the margins, 
    grace abounds.
