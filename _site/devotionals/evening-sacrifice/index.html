<h2>✨ Devotional Reflection</h2>
<p>David’s words in Psalm 141:2 are more than poetic—they’re priestly.<br>
He’s not just praying; he’s offering.<br>
Not just speaking; he’s surrendering.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel, incense was burned in the tabernacle as a symbol of prayer rising to God—fragrant, intentional, and holy.<br>
The evening sacrifice was a daily act of devotion, a rhythm of surrender and worship.</p>
<p>David longs for his prayer to carry that same weight.<br>
He wants his words to rise like incense—pleasing, pure, and persistent.<br>
He wants his lifted hands to echo the sacrifice—an offering of self, not just ritual.</p>

<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, let my prayer rise to You like incense.<br>
Let my worship be more than words—let it be surrender.<br>
Teach me to lift my hands not just in need, but in reverence.<br>
May my life be a daily offering, pleasing in Your sight.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<h2>💡 Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Prayer isn’t just communication—it’s consecration.<br>
Let your words rise like incense.<br>
Let your worship echo the evening sacrifice.<br>
<strong>God delights in hearts that offer themselves fully.</strong></p>
