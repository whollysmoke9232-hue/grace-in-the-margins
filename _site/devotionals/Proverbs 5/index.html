    <p>Proverbs 5</p>
<p><strong>The Anatomy of Temptation: An Exposition of Proverbs 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The book of Proverbs is a masterclass in the art of living, a collection of divine wisdom that contrasts the path of righteousness with the path of folly. In chapter 5, the writer, traditionally held to be Solomon, presents a stark and powerful warning against the destructive power of sexual sin, personified as the &quot;adulterous woman.&quot; Using vivid, visceral imagery, these verses dissect the anatomy of temptation, revealing its alluring disguise, its destructive destination, and the ultimate divine oversight that every human being must face. It is a timeless warning that peels back the veneer of fleeting pleasure to expose the rot and ruin that lie beneath.</p>
<p><strong>The Deceptive Allure (Proverbs 5:3-4)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.&quot;</p>
<p>The initial presentation of temptation is intoxicatingly sweet. The writer uses two powerful sensory metaphors: honey and oil. Honey represents an immediate, natural, and overwhelming sweetness. It speaks to the powerful appeal to our fleshly appetites. The words of temptation are not harsh or repulsive; they are enticing, promising satisfaction and pleasure. Her speech is &quot;smoother than oil,&quot; suggesting a frictionless entry into the heart and mind. It is persuasive, charming, and disarming, calming our conscience and lubricating the path toward compromise. This is the great deception: sin rarely presents itself as it truly is. It wears a mask of beauty, promises fulfillment, and whispers words that our ears want to hear.</p>
<p>However, the writer immediately shatters this illusion by revealing the &quot;end&quot; of this path. The sweetness of honey gives way to the bitterness of &quot;gall&quot; (or wormwood), a substance known for its extreme, nauseating bitterness. This is the aftertaste of sin—the regret, the shame, the relational ruin, and the spiritual sickness that follow. The smooth words of oil are replaced by the sharp reality of a &quot;double-edged sword.&quot; This imagery is potent. A double-edged sword cuts both ways, signifying that this path brings comprehensive destruction. It wounds the sinner and the one sinned against. It damages one's relationship with others and severs one's communion with God. The very thing that promised smooth pleasure becomes the instrument of a deep and painful wound.</p>
<p><strong>The Destructive Path (Proverbs 5:5-6, 8)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it... Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house.&quot;</p>
<p>The passage moves from the character of temptation to its consequence. The destination is not merely unpleasant; it is fatal. &quot;Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.&quot; This is not just a warning of physical death that could result from jealousy or disease, but a profound spiritual statement. This path is a descent into a life devoid of true vitality, purpose, and connection with God—a spiritual death that culminates in eternal separation.</p>
<p>Verse 6 reveals the tragic internal state of one on this path: &quot;She gives no thought to the way of life.&quot; There is a profound lack of self-awareness and foresight. The focus is entirely on the immediate gratification of the moment, with no consideration for the long-term trajectory. Her paths &quot;wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.&quot; This speaks to a life that has lost its moral compass. It drifts from one compromise to the next, driven by impulse rather than principle. The most frightening part is the ignorance—&quot;she does not know it.&quot; She is so lost in the fog of her choices that she cannot see how far she has strayed from the &quot;way of life.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of this deceptive allure and destructive end, the counsel in verse 8 is not moderation, but radical avoidance. &quot;Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house.&quot; Wisdom does not entertain temptation or see how close it can get to the line without crossing it. Wisdom sees the danger from a distance and changes its route entirely. It understands that the power of the allure described in verse 3 is too strong to trifle with. The only safe strategy is to create distance, to refuse even to approach the context of compromise.</p>
<p><strong>The Divine Witness (Proverbs 5:21)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;For your ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all your paths.&quot;</p>
<p>This final verse elevates the warning from the horizontal (human consequences) to the vertical (divine accountability). It serves as the ultimate reason to heed the previous warnings. Nothing is done in secret. The &quot;paths&quot; we walk, whether toward wisdom or toward folly, are in &quot;full view of the LORD.&quot; The darkness that promises to hide illicit acts is, before God, as bright as day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God is not a passive observer; &quot;he examines all your paths.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;examines&quot; can also mean &quot;to weigh&quot; or &quot;to make level.&quot; It implies careful scrutiny and judgment. God weighs our choices, our motives, and the direction of our lives. This truth is both a comfort and a warning. It is a warning to those on the path of folly that there will be an ultimate accounting. Every wandering step is noted. But it is a comfort to those striving to walk in wisdom, for it means that every effort to stay on the right path, every decision to &quot;keep far from her,&quot; is also seen, valued, and honored by God. It reminds us that our struggle for purity and righteousness is not in vain; it is witnessed and weighed by the one whose opinion matters most.</p>
<p>This is both sobering and comforting. Sobering—because nothing is hidden. Comforting—because God watches with care, not condemnation. He examines our paths not to shame us, but to guide us.</p>
<p>This verse reframes the entire warning: we are not alone in our struggle. God is present, attentive, and invested in our choices.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Proverbs 5:3-6, 8, and 21 provide a comprehensive and sobering anatomy of temptation. It begins with a seductive promise of honey and oil but ends in the bitterness of gall and the wound of a sword. It is a path that descends into death, characterized by a tragic, aimless wandering. Therefore, the only wise response is radical avoidance, motivated by the ultimate truth that our lives are lived in full view of a holy God who sees, examines, and weighs every step we take. This ancient wisdom calls us to look beyond the immediate allure of any temptation and to measure our choices not by their short-term appeal, but by their final destination.</p>
<p><strong>Application: Walking in Wisdom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discern the sweet from the deadly</strong> Not everything that feels good is good</li>
<li><strong>Practice distance</strong> Don’t rely on willpower alone—build guardrails</li>
<li><strong>Live with awareness</strong> God sees, knows, and cares. Let His presence shape your path</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Prayer for Wisdom</strong>
O Lord, whose eyes are in every place, examining the paths of all mankind, we come before You with humble hearts. We confess that we are often enticed by fleeting pleasures that mask a deeper poison. Grant us the wisdom to discern the honey that hides the gall, and the smooth words that conceal a sword.</p>
<p>Father, give us the courage not merely to fight temptation, but to flee from it. Help us to build walls of protection and to walk so far from the door of compromise that its siren call fades into silence. Keep our feet firmly on the path of life, and when we begin to wander, gently and firmly guide us back.</p>
<p>May the truth that we live in Your full view lead us to a holy reverence that shapes our every choice. Let Your presence be our comfort and our guard. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Your glory and our ultimate good.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus, our firm foundation and redeemer, we pray.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
