    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities… have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.”</em><br>
—Romans 1:19–20</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🌠 Creation Shouts</h2>
<p>God doesn’t whisper His identity into the cosmos—He shouts it.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked up at a starlit sky and felt an overwhelming sense of wonder?<br>
Or marveled at the intricate design of a tiny flower, or the precision of the human eye?</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul tells us in Romans that these moments are more than just awe-inspiring;<br>
they are a direct revelation of God Himself.</p>
<p>Creation is His signature.<br>
The stars, the subatomic particles, the neural paths in our brains—each one reflects eternal power and intentional design.<br>
The complexity of all life speaks of a Creator who is both transcendent and immanent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧭 Conscience Confirms</h2>
<p>And then there's conscience.</p>
<p>Inside each person is a moral compass—a recognition of right and wrong not taught, but known.<br>
We don’t always follow it. In fact, we rarely do perfectly.<br>
But the recognition itself is proof of divine fingerprint.</p>
<p>God has gone to great lengths to make Himself known to humanity.<br>
He hasn't hidden Himself away in some secret realm, accessible only to a select few.<br>
Instead, <em>“what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.”</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Divine Evidence</h2>
<p><strong>His eternal power</strong> is magnificently revealed in both the grandeur of the universe and the minute precision of the sub-atomic world.<br>
From the dizzying expanse of galaxies to the delicate dance of electrons,<br>
the sheer scale and complexity of existence scream of an omnipotent Creator.</p>
<p><strong>His divine nature</strong> is revealed within us.<br>
We intuitively understand justice, fairness, and morality—even when our actions contradict these innate principles.<br>
This universal moral compass, though often dulled by sin, is a testament to the character of our holy and just God.</p>
<p>Because God has made Himself so clearly evident—through the majesty of His creation and the whispers of our conscience—Paul concludes that <em>“people are without excuse.”</em></p>
<p>The witness is undeniable.<br>
The question is not whether God has revealed Himself,<br>
but whether we will respond to what has been made so plain.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>How has God's &quot;eternal power&quot; been clearly seen in your life or in the world around you lately?</li>
<li>In what ways do you recognize God's &quot;divine nature&quot; through your own conscience or the universal understanding of right and wrong?</li>
<li>Given that God has made Himself plain, what is your response to Him today?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>💬 Devotional Reflection</h2>
<p>Romans makes it clear: the evidence is everywhere.<br>
To live in rebellion against God’s law is to reject what is plain.<br>
We are not innocent by ignorance.<br>
Creation declares.<br>
Conscience confirms.<br>
The invitation is constant.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You for revealing Yourself so clearly—in the skies above,<br>
in the intricacies within, and in the quiet convictions of our hearts.<br>
Help me live not in defiance of what I know, but in surrender to Who You are.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
