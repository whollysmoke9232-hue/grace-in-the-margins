      <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“…I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there’ and it will move…”</em><br>
—Matthew 17:20</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>✨ Devotional: Mustard Seed Faith</h2>
<p>I used to think that verse was good news…<br>
If I ever needed to move a mountain.</p>
<p>But then I began to notice the kind of faith so many displayed when Jesus walked among them—faith that wasn’t flashy or loud, but persistent, expectant, and deeply rooted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The woman with the issue of blood <em>(Luke 8:43)</em></li>
<li>The lame man at the Pool of Bethesda <em>(John 5:1)</em></li>
<li>The paralytic lowered through the roof <em>(Mark 2:3)</em></li>
<li>The groom at Cana <em>(John 2:1)</em></li>
<li>The grieving mother in Nain <em>(Luke 7:11)</em></li>
<li>The man with a withered hand <em>(Mark 3:1)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And then—perhaps most remarkably—the miracle of multiplication in <em>Matthew 14:15–33</em>.<br>
Five loaves. Two fish. 20,000 hungry people.<br>
And twelve disciples who had no idea that today, they’d be part of the miracle.</p>
<p>Jesus blessed the bread. Broke it. Handed a piece to the first disciple…<br>
Yet somehow, both the disciple and Jesus were holding full loaves.<br>
It continued with each disciple—and then with each recipient.</p>
<p>Not only did they <em>see</em> the miracle…<br>
They <em>took part</em> in it.</p>
<p>Then, as if to seal the moment, Jesus had each disciple collect a basket overflowing with leftovers—tangible evidence of faith meeting divine abundance.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌊 Faith in the Storm</h2>
<p>But just hours later, fear returned.<br>
In the boat, the disciples trembled as Jesus walked toward them on the water.</p>
<p>Peter dared to believe—mustard seed faith—and for a moment, he walked on water.<br>
But doubt crept in when he focused more on the wind than the Savior.</p>
<p>When Peter began to sink, Jesus caught him immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“O you of little faith…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words weren’t a rebuke.<br>
They were a reminder:<br>
<strong>Even little faith is powerful when pointed toward Me.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer Reflection</h2>
<p><em>Lord, help us not despise the days of small faith.<br>
Thank You for catching us when we sink.<br>
Remind us that mustard seed faith is more than enough in Your hands.<br>
Teach us to fix our eyes on You—through storms, through wonder—and trust that You’ll never let us fall.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
