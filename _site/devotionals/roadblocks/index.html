      <h1>Roadblocks: Getting Out of Our Own Way</h1>
<p>Why is it so hard to get out of our own way?</p>
<p>If a runaway dump truck were barreling toward us, every fiber of our being would scream, <em>&quot;Get out of the way!&quot;</em> And we would.<br>
If we knew a meteorite was heading for our location, we'd scramble to safety.<br>
If someone intended us harm, we'd instinctively flee.</p>
<p>These are situations where our natural &quot;fight or flight&quot; response kicks in, driving us to preserve ourselves.</p>
<p>But what about when something <strong>good</strong> is coming our way?</p>
<p>It seems that the biggest roadblock to receiving all that God desires for us is often‚Ä¶ <em>us</em>.<br>
Read that again: we can be the <strong>biggest obstacle to God's blessings</strong> in our lives.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm reminded of a &quot;Preacher's Story&quot; I heard years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A certain man died and went to heaven. Upon arrival, he was met by Jesus, who immediately began to show him around.<br>
He saw all his family who had arrived before him. He was introduced to heroes from the Bible and the early Church.<br>
Jesus showed him the streets of gold, the tree of life, the Ark of the Covenant, and even the mansion that had been built for him since before time began.</p>
<p>In time, the man noticed a street Jesus seemed to be avoiding, so he asked to see it.<br>
As they walked down that street, he saw row after row of warehouses.<br>
They came upon one that bore his name. Jesus opened the door to reveal countless riches and blessings.<br>
&quot;What is all this?&quot; the man asked, astonished.</p>
<p>Jesus replied, <em>&quot;These are all the things I wanted to give you, but couldn‚Äôt, because you were too busy chasing other 'things.'&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This powerful story echoes Jesus' words in the Parable of the Sower:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúStill others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.‚Äù<br>
‚Äî Mark 4:18‚Äì19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind: the ‚Äúother things‚Äù aren‚Äôt bad in and of themselves.<br>
They are just <strong>not Him</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The only thing that can truly <strong>limit the Holy Spirit‚Äôs effectiveness</strong> in our lives is ourselves.</p>
<p>God wants to <strong>change us. Re-create us. Make us ‚Äúnew‚Äù beings</strong> (Revelation 21:5).<br>
He is not interested in making us ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù<br>
He is about the business of making us <strong>new</strong>‚Äîwho we were created to be, not just a better version of who we are.</p>
<p>So, how long will we continue to get in His way?<br>
How long will we keep chasing &quot;other things&quot;?</p>
<p>Sometimes, these &quot;other things&quot; even seem like good pursuits‚Äîlike diligent Bible study, dedicated community service, or creative endeavors such as writing.<br>
Yet, anything not primarily motivated by seeking Him first becomes an &quot;other thing&quot; (Matthew 6:33).<br>
Our focus shifts from the <strong>Giver</strong> to the gifts, from <strong>His plan</strong> to our pursuits.</p>
<hr>
<p>Will you join me in drawing a line in the sand and declaring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Enough is enough! I'm tired of trying the same thing over and over, while expecting a different outcome.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want something you've never had,<br>
You must be willing to do something you've never done.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôm giving up. I surrender. I want God's best for me‚Äîwhatever that is.</strong><br>
And to receive it, I'm going to <strong>get out of the way</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>üôè Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>Lord,</strong><br>
Pull up the thorns.<br>
Unmask the subtle distractions.<br>
Help me hear Your voice freshly and bear fruit that lasts.<br>
I don‚Äôt want growth‚ÄîI want <strong>You</strong>.</p>
