      <h1>üïäÔ∏è Starved or Fed?</h1>
<p><em>Devotional Reflection by Steve Wilkins</em></p>
<p>We ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's God's will for my life?</li>
<li>Who should I marry?</li>
<li>What's my calling?</li>
<li>What's God saying to me about this crisis, this friend, this ache in my marriage?</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet, with all the desperation for answers, we so often neglect the clearest Voice we've been given: the Word of God.</p>
<p>We search:</p>
<ul>
<li>A song that moved us</li>
<li>A sermon that stirred something</li>
<li>A conversation with a mentor</li>
</ul>
<p>These may carry glimpses of truth, echoes of God's heart. But if King Jesus is who we long to hear from, why aren't we looking directly in His Word?</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<p>Do I believe the Bible is God-breathed? Alive? Sharp?
Not just a book of suggestions‚Ä¶
But the blueprint for every breath, every burden, every breakthrough?</p>
<p>Here's the hard question:
Can you quote one Scripture from memory for every year you've walked with Jesus?
Not as a rule, but as a measure of where you've built your spiritual vocabulary.</p>
<p>We celebrate the idea of the Bible in the Church.
We'll even fight for the <em>right</em> to own one‚Ä¶
...and then leave it untouched in a closet.</p>
<p>We're not being punished.
We're not condemned.
You are <em>as righteous and holy as you'll ever need to be</em>, by the finished work of Jesus.</p>
<p>But let's be honest:
There's something wrong if nothing feels wrong about neglecting God's Word.</p>
<p>We study all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sports stats</li>
<li>Headlines</li>
<li>Music trivia</li>
<li>Investment strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>We're students by nature.
The deeper question is: <em>What are we students of?</em></p>
<h2>ü™û What do you long to have revealed to you each day?</h2>
<p>Let Psalm 119:9‚Äì16 reorient your appetite:</p>
<p><em>How can a young man keep his way pure?</em></p>
<p><em>By guarding it according to your word.</em></p>
<p><em>With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p><em>I have stored up your word in my heart,</em></p>
<p><em>that I might not sin against you.</em></p>
<p>The Word of God is not a side dish. It's your daily bread.
Open it. Eat. Marinate in its mystery.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about Bible Study is this:
You don't need commentary, credentials, or clarity‚Äîjust the Bible, and a willing heart.</p>
