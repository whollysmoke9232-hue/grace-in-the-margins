      <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The LORD’S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,<br>
For His compassions never fail.<br>
They are new every morning;<br>
Great is Your faithfulness.”</em><br>
—Lamentations 3:22–23</p>

<h2>🎨 A Mural of Mercy</h2>
<p>There is no end to the creative ways God reveals His love.<br>
Just when I think He’s exhausted every method—<strong>BOOM!</strong> Another masterpiece of mercy.<br>
A sunset, a flower, a memory.<br>
A smile from a stranger, or even a whisper in correction.<br>
Each one becomes a brushstroke in His eternal mural of compassion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The LORD’S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He knows my heart, my frailty, my thoughts—because He made me.<br>
He designed every response, every longing.<br>
And when I’m hurting, afraid, lonely, or confused,<br>
He meets me with the perfect passage of Scripture.<br>
Not as a distant deity, but as Immanuel—God with us.<br>
God <em>with me.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“For His compassions never fail.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each new morning reveals more of His endless care.<br>
His Word, His people, His discipline, His healing—layer after layer of love.<br>
Nothing withheld.<br>
No moment untouched by grace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“They are new every morning.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is constant.<br>
Unchanging.<br>
Faithful in every season.<br>
The sun never skips a morning.<br>
Winter always yields to spring.<br>
And I am always—<em>always</em>—held in His hands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Great is Your faithfulness.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🙏 A Breath of Praise</h2>
<p>*Lord, thank You for pursuing me endlessly,<br>
for loving me creatively and faithfully.<br>
Let my mornings greet Your mercy<br>
and my nights rest in Your compassion.<br>
And even when I don’t feel it—when my heart forgets—<br>
remind me again, like sunrise after darkness,<br>
that Your love has <strong>never ceased.*</strong><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<h2>🔍 Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>In what specific, perhaps unexpected, ways have you seen God demonstrate His lovingkindness recently?</li>
<li>How does the truth that God knows exactly how you feel bring you comfort in your current circumstances?</li>
<li>As you begin this new day, how can you intentionally look for and appreciate God's &quot;new every morning&quot; compassions?</li>
</ol>
