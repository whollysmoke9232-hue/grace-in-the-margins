<blockquote>
<p><em>“What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!”</em><br>
—Romans 6:21</p>

<h2>✨ Devotional: The Bitter Harvest of Sin</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul pulls back the curtain on a harsh truth about sin, one we often learn the hard way.<br>
He asks a piercing question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sin isn’t just wrong.<br>
It’s irrational.</p>
<p>Think about it.<br>
We've all chased after fleeting pleasures or rebellious desires, convinced in the moment that they would bring us satisfaction or freedom.<br>
Perhaps it was a lie, an indulgence, a moment of anger, or a selfish pursuit.<br>
In that instant, there might have been a flicker of joy, a rush of pleasure, or a sense of temporary relief.</p>
<p>But Paul's question forces us to look beyond that fleeting moment.<br>
He points to the inevitable aftermath:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Those things result in death!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not just physical death, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual death</li>
<li>Relational death</li>
<li>Emotional death</li>
<li>The death of peace and joy</li>
</ul>
<p>When we look back on those choices, the feeling isn't satisfaction, but <strong>shame</strong>.<br>
That immediate gratification gives way to lasting heartache, regret, and a sense of being diminished.</p>
<p>No sin has ever brought lasting happiness.<br>
It promises much but delivers only emptiness and pain.</p>
<hr>
<h2>💭 The Foolishness of Sin</h2>
<p>There’s no lasting joy in rebellion—only regret.<br>
We chase what sparkles for a moment, only to find it dulls, disappoints, and damages.</p>
<p>Paul doesn’t mince words.<br>
What did those things give you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain</li>
<li>Loss</li>
<li>Shame</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve all tasted it—the bitter aftertaste of temporary pleasure.<br>
We look back and call it what it is.<br>
Not just sinful.<br>
<strong>Stupid.</strong></p>
<p>It's a stark reminder that sin isn't just morally wrong; it's profoundly <strong>foolish</strong>.<br>
It offers a deceptive illusion of benefit, only to leave us with a bitter harvest of shame and separation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌿 The Hope of Grace</h2>
<p>And yet—God doesn’t leave us in shame.<br>
He offers grace.</p>
<p>The path of righteousness leads to life.<br>
The gospel invites us out of the grave and into the garden.</p>
<p>Transformation begins with truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admitting that sin leaves us empty</li>
<li>Trusting the One who fills us with life</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no such thing as a secret sin with a happy ending.<br>
What once felt thrilling ends up throwing us into despair.<br>
But in Christ, we’re invited into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renewal</li>
<li>Wisdom</li>
<li>Life</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news, of course, is that in Christ, we are set free from the power of sin.<br>
We are no longer slaves to those things that lead to death.<br>
But recognizing the true, destructive nature of sin helps us to flee from it and embrace the life, joy, and freedom found in obedience to God.</p>

<h2>❓ Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Can you recall a time when a seemingly pleasurable sin ultimately led to heartache or shame? What did you learn from that experience?</li>
<li>How does understanding sin as &quot;stupid&quot; (leading to no true benefit) motivate you to turn away from it?</li>
<li>What are you currently doing to embrace the life and freedom that Christ offers, rather than falling back into the deceptive traps of sin?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You for the clarity of Your Word.<br>
Help me recognize the traps that masquerade as treasures.<br>
Remind me that sin never brings life—only You do.<br>
Give me the courage to turn from foolishness and walk in freedom.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
