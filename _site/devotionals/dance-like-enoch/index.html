        <em>Tip: Highlight a word to see its definition.</em>
      </p>
      <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.”</em><br>
–Genesis 5:24</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>🔥 The Broken Beginning</h2>
<p>In 1999, we didn’t plan revival. We didn’t schedule an awakening.<br>
We just reached the end of ourselves—and God showed up.</p>
<p>Our church had lost its leaders and direction, but in that vacuum of certainty, the Spirit stirred something deep.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prayer became our oxygen.</li>
<li>Worship became our warfare.</li>
</ul>
<p>And one Sunday, heaven breached the ordinary.</p>
<p>People flooded the altar. They wept, collapsed, cried out.<br>
Salvation came—not just in services, but in the foyer, in the parking lot.<br>
Miracles unfolded. Healings. Marriages restored. Callings ignited.</p>
<p>And as the Worship Leader, I saw it.</p>
<p>Literally.<br>
I saw the Spirit sweep across the room.<br>
I saw the wave that dropped people to their knees.<br>
I saw the Glory Cloud.<br>
And once—I saw the battlefield. Angels engaged in warfare.<br>
I wasn’t fighting…I was feeding them.<br>
With praise. With worship. With intercession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our intensity fueled their victory.<br>
Their victory ignited ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>💔 The Cost of Praise</h2>
<p>Isaiah said, <em>“Woe is me...I am undone.”</em><br>
And that’s how I felt.<br>
Undone by the power.<br>
Exposed by my pride.</p>
<p>Loving God meant giving Him <em>everything</em>—heart, soul, mind, and strength.<br>
And that kind of love costs something.</p>
<p>As David said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I will not offer to the Lord that which costs me nothing.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the price is pride.<br>
To truly worship, I must be seen—not as balanced, but as broken.<br>
Not polished, but present.<br>
I must die to image and awaken to intimacy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌱 Legacy Through Worship</h2>
<p>Wayne Watson once sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I want to get so close to Him that it’s no big change on that day when Jesus calls my name.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enoch knew what that meant.<br>
Worship led him closer and closer…until heaven simply folded him in.</p>
<p>His intimacy left a legacy—one that reached Noah, whose faith helped save mankind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if our worship today fuels victories for generations to come?<br>
What if our surrender becomes their sanctuary?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, I want to love You with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength.<br>
Kill my pride.<br>
Strip away my self-awareness.<br>
Make me childlike again.<br>
Let my worship empower the angelic battle for the lost, the hurting, the bound.<br>
Make me a conduit.<br>
Let me dance like Enoch danced—until I’m so close to You, I don’t even notice when heaven takes me home.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
