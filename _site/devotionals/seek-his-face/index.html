    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.<br>
Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.<br>
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat—<br>
for He grants sleep to those He loves.”</em><br>
—Psalm 127:1–2</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>✨ Devotional: Seek His Face, Not Just His Hand</h2>
<p>God desires to be desired.<br>
Not for what He can give, but for who He is.<br>
He longs for us to seek His face—not just His hand.</p>
<p>Too often, our prayers are filled with requests for provision, protection, and promotion.<br>
And while God is a generous Father who delights in blessing His children,<br>
He never intended for His gifts to replace His presence.</p>
<p>When we chase after blessings, we find ourselves weary, frustrated, and spiritually dry.<br>
But when we chase after Him, everything changes.</p>
<p>Psalm 127 reminds us that all our striving is in vain unless the Lord is at the center.<br>
We can build, guard, hustle, and grind—but without Him, it’s empty.<br>
Yet when we seek Him first, when we make Him our pursuit <em>(Matthew 6:33)</em>,<br>
His blessings follow us—even in our sleep.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔄 Shift the Focus</h2>
<p>God doesn’t want to be a means to an end.<br>
<strong>He is the end.</strong><br>
<strong>He is the reward.</strong></p>
<p>And when we seek Him—not for what He can do, but for who He is—<br>
we find rest.<br>
We find peace.<br>
We find purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🏹 A Picture of Blessing</h2>
<p>Psalm 127 goes on to describe children as arrows in the hand of a warrior.<br>
They are a sign of strength, legacy, and divine favor.</p>
<p>But this truth extends beyond children.<br>
Every blessing from God—whether it’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Provision</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Peace</li>
</ul>
<p>—is a byproduct of His presence.</p>
<p>When we dwell with Him, we walk in confidence.<br>
Not because of what we have, but because of <strong>who is with us</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>⚖️ Facing the Gate</h2>
<p>The psalm ends with a powerful image: standing before the “judges in the gate.”<br>
These were the authorities, the decision-makers, the ones who could determine your fate.</p>
<p>But when you know you’re walking with God, you don’t fear the gate.<br>
You don’t fear the verdict.</p>
<p>Because no matter what the world decides,<br>
you are held in the hand of the One who reigns above it all.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, forgive me for the times I’ve sought Your hand more than Your heart.<br>
Teach me to desire You above all else.<br>
Help me to seek Your face daily, to rest in Your presence,<br>
and to trust that every good thing flows from You.<br>
I want to dwell with You—not just visit.<br>
I want to know You—not just need You.<br>
Be my pursuit, my portion, and my peace.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>📌 Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>When you seek His face, His hand will follow.<br>
When you dwell in His presence, His blessings will find you—<strong>even in your sleep.</strong></p>
