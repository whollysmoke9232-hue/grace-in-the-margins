    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Jesus wept.”</em><br>
—John 11:35</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the shortest verse in the Bible—just two words.<br>
But those two words carry the weight of eternity.<br>
<strong>“Jesus wept.”</strong></p>
<p>Why would the Son of God, who knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, stop to weep?</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌍 Back to the Beginning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.”</em><br>
—Genesis 1:31</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, there was no death.<br>
No sorrow.<br>
No brokenness.<br>
Creation pulsed with harmony, beauty, and life.</p>
<p>But then came the fall.<br>
Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came the curse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Cursed is the ground because of you…”</em><br>
—Genesis 3:17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that moment on, everything changed.<br>
Sin infected not just human hearts, but the very fabric of creation.<br>
Death became a reality.<br>
Tears became a language.<br>
And the world began to groan under the weight of what was lost.</p>
<hr>
<h2>💔 The Grief of God</h2>
<p>So when Jesus stood at Lazarus’ tomb and saw Mary weeping, Scripture says He was “deeply moved in spirit and troubled.”<br>
The Greek word used here suggests more than sadness—it implies indignation, even outrage.</p>
<p>Jesus wasn’t angry at the people.<br>
He wasn’t even angry at their grief.<br>
He was angry at what sin had done.<br>
At the pain, the loss, the distortion of what was once “very good.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔎 Why Jesus Wept</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jesus wept because this was not how it was supposed to be.</li>
<li>He wept over the sting of death.</li>
<li>He wept over the sorrow of His friends.</li>
<li>He wept over a world broken by sin.</li>
</ul>
<p>And He still weeps today.<br>
Not because He is powerless.<br>
Not because He is surprised.<br>
But because He loves.<br>
And love always grieves what wounds the beloved.</p>
<p>Jesus hates sin—not just because it’s wrong,<br>
But because of what it does to us.<br>
To His creation.<br>
To His children.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord Jesus, thank You for being a Savior who weeps.<br>
Thank You for feeling the weight of our sorrow and the sting of our brokenness.<br>
Help me to hate sin—not just for what it is, but for what it does.<br>
Give me eyes to see the world as You see it, and a heart that longs for restoration.<br>
May I live in the hope that You are making all things new.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Jesus doesn’t just hate sin because it’s rebellion—<br>
He hates it because it breaks what He loves.<br>
And one day, He will wipe away every tear…<br>
<strong>Because He wept first.</strong></p>
