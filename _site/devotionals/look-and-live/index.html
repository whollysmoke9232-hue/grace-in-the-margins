    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br>
so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.”</em><br>
—John 3:14–15</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>✨ Devotional: Just Look and Live</h2>
<p>In the wilderness, the Israelites were dying—bitten by serpents, the consequence of their rebellion.<br>
But God, in His mercy, provided a way of healing: a bronze serpent lifted high on a pole.<br>
There was no ritual, no sacrifice, no work required.<br>
Just one thing: <strong>look.</strong><br>
And <strong>live.</strong></p>
<p>That moment in Israel’s history was more than a rescue—it was a foreshadowing.<br>
Jesus pointed back to it when He said, <em>“Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”</em><br>
Just as the bronze serpent was raised for healing, Christ would be lifted on the cross for our salvation.</p>
<p>And the invitation remains the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not “work harder.”</li>
<li>Not “clean yourself up.”</li>
<li>Not “prove you’re worthy.”<br>
Just… <strong>look.</strong><br>
Look to Jesus.<br>
Believe.<br>
And live.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💭 Reflection</h2>
<p>We often complicate grace.<br>
We try to earn what can only be received.<br>
But the gospel is stunning in its simplicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For God so loved the world…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That includes you.<br>
That includes your mess, your doubts, your failures.</p>
<p>He gave His only Son—not to condemn you, but to save you.</p>
<p>Jesus is the Judge, yes.<br>
But He didn’t come to slam the gavel—He came to open the door.<br>
The judgment isn’t in His coming; it’s in our response.<br>
The Light has come.<br>
Will we turn toward it… or away?</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord Jesus, thank You for being lifted up for me.<br>
I confess that I often try to earn what You’ve already given.<br>
Help me to simply look to You in faith.<br>
Thank You for loving me before I ever loved You.<br>
Today, I choose to believe.<br>
I choose to live.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>You don’t have to climb your way to God.<br>
You don’t have to fix yourself first.<br>
You just have to look.<br>
<strong>Look to Jesus.</strong><br>
And <strong>live.</strong></p>
