    <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.’”</em><br>
—Acts 13:22</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”</em><br>
—1 Samuel 16:7</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb.”</em><br>
—Psalm 139:13</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 The Paradox of David</h2>
<p>“All My will?”</p>
<p>David’s record doesn’t immediately affirm that claim.<br>
He was passive with Joab (2 Samuel 3:27), reckless with the Ark (2 Samuel 6:1–7), and painfully flawed in his encounter with Bathsheba—marked by complacency, lust, deception, and murder (2 Samuel 11).<br>
He ignored Amnon’s sin, distanced himself from Absalom, tolerated idol worship (1 Samuel 19:13), and defied God by ordering a census (2 Samuel 24).</p>
<p>How can a man with such a checkered past be held up as the standard by God Himself—the one who would <em>“do all My will”</em>?</p>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Divine Insight</h2>
<p>And yet… God said David did <em>all</em> His will.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Because God doesn’t judge as man judges.<br>
He looks beyond the fall and into the fabric of the heart.<br>
God's assessment of David wasn't a blind overlook of his sins, but an eternal, holistic view of David's core being and his ultimate orientation toward God.</p>
<p>The books of Kings consistently use David as the benchmark for faithfulness—not because he was perfect, but because his heart, at its deepest level, sought God.</p>
<p>Even through David’s failures, God saw a heart that broke rightly—one that repented quickly, worshiped deeply, and returned again and again to the mercy seat.<br>
In Psalm 51, David bowed low in the light of conviction and pleaded for cleansing and restoration.<br>
God heard—and He restored.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧩 Grace in Weakness</h2>
<p>God’s ways are consistent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul’s thorn wasn’t punishment—it was grace (2 Corinthians 12:7–10).</li>
<li>Job’s suffering wasn’t proof of guilt—it was a divine endorsement of integrity (Job 1–2).</li>
<li>David’s restoration wasn’t earned—it was received through repentance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This truth offers incredible comfort and challenge for us.</p>
<p>God knows us intimately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb.”</em> —Psalm 139:13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He crafted every aspect of our being—including what we perceive as our flaws or weaknesses.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🃏 Playing Your Hand</h2>
<p>It’s as if God has dealt us a hand of cards—some strong, some less so.<br>
He knows every card in our hand.</p>
<p>So when we cry out to Him, frustrated because we've fallen into that same old sin,<br>
He doesn’t respond with anger <em>at us</em>.<br>
He gets angry <em>at what sin has done to us</em>—His dearly beloved children.</p>
<p>His heart breaks for the impact sin has on our lives and on His creation.<br>
He lovingly whispers, <em>“I know. I dealt you that card, and My grace is sufficient.”</em></p>
<p>God is watching to see how we <em>play our hand</em>.<br>
David, despite his dramatic stumbles, ultimately played his hand well because his heart remained fixed on God.</p>
<p>His life teaches us that being <em>“a man after God's own heart”</em> isn’t about sinless perfection,<br>
but about a sincere and repentant heart that consistently turns toward God,<br>
allowing His grace to be perfected in our weakness.</p>

<h2>🔍 Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>How does understanding God's focus on the heart, rather than just outward actions, change your perception of your own struggles and imperfections?</li>
<li>In what ways might you be &quot;playing your hand&quot; poorly by trying to hide your weaknesses from God or others?</li>
<li>How can the truth of God knowing your deepest parts (Psalm 139) encourage you to bring your full self, including your &quot;thorns,&quot; before Him?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p>Merciful Father, thank You for the profound truth that You look at our hearts.<br>
Thank You that You know us completely, even our deepest weaknesses, and that Your grace is always sufficient.<br>
Forgive us for the times we focus on outward appearances or become discouraged by our failures.<br>
Help us to cultivate a heart that truly seeks You, a heart that is quick to repent and always turns back to You.<br>
May we live in the freedom of Your abundant grace, trusting that You are perfecting Your power in our weakness._<br>
<strong>In Jesus' name, Amen.</strong></p>
