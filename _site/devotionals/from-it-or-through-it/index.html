      <h2>From It or Through It</h2>
<p><strong>Key Scripture:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.<br>
But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”<br>
–Daniel 3:17–18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine the scene: three teenagers, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, standing defiantly before King Nebuchadnezzar, the most powerful man in the known world. Their crime? Refusing to bow before his golden statue. Facing certain, agonizing death in a superheated furnace, their response wasn't a plea for mercy, but a declaration of profound faith.</p>
<p>Their surrender wasn’t to the flame, but to the sovereignty of God.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Our God is able to deliver us,&quot;</em> they proclaimed with unwavering conviction.<br>
But then came the kicker: <em>&quot;But even if He does not...&quot;</em></p>
<p>This wasn't a lack of faith; it was the ultimate expression of it. They believed in the absolute sovereignty of God. In essence, they were saying, &quot;We have faith that God will save us – either <em>from</em> the fire, or <em>through</em> the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Their response infuriated the king. He commanded the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual and had them thrown in.</p>
<p>But they weren’t alone.</p>
<p>Daniel records a fourth man walking with them—like “a son of the gods.” Many believe this was a pre-incarnate visitation of Jesus Christ Himself. Their steadfast faith had captured God's attention so powerfully that He sent His Son to comfort and encourage them as they walked through the most terrifying trial of their lives.</p>
<p>When they emerged from the furnace, the evidence of God's miraculous intervention was undeniable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them.” –Daniel 3:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But something <em>was</em> burned away—the ropes that bound them.</p>
<p>The only thing destroyed by the fire was the very ropes that bound them! They came out of the fire un-singed, unmolested, and <strong>unbound</strong>. The fire that the enemy intended to kill them actually set them free. God turned the tables and demonstrated that He can deliver His children from the worst the world can throw at them.</p>
<p>The very thing meant to destroy them became the tool God used to liberate and elevate them.</p>
<p>Our God hasn't changed. He still uses what seems to be the worst that could happen to us to make us stronger and prepare us for the mission He has placed before us.</p>
<p>And notice this powerful truth: Jesus didn't come out of the fire. He entered it <em>with</em> them. He can always be found in the deepest water, the toughest mountain, the steepest valley, and the hottest fire of our lives. He is there with us – to comfort, strengthen, encourage, and carry us through. We are never alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.” –1 Corinthians 3:15<br>
“Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.” –Isaiah 48:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you find yourself in the fire of affliction today?</strong><br>
Perhaps you're feeling the heat of overwhelming challenges, crushing sorrow, or relentless pressure. It's easy to feel alone, forgotten, or consumed by the flames.</p>
<p>But hear these timeless truths:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.” –Daniel 10:12<br>
“I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.” –Psalms 16:8<br>
“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are crushed in spirit.” –Psalms 34:18<br>
“And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.” –Psalms 39:7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can face any trial that is placed before us with complete confidence that He will save us — either <em>from</em> it or <em>through</em> it. Our ultimate salvation is secure in Him, and even when we walk through the flames of this life, He is right there, ensuring that the only thing consumed is what binds us, leaving us stronger, refined, and free.</p>

<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What &quot;furnace&quot; are you currently facing in your life? How does the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego encourage you to trust God, even if His deliverance looks different than you expect?</li>
<li>How does knowing that Jesus is <em>with</em> you in the midst of your trials change your perspective?</li>
<li>Take a moment to simply &quot;wait&quot; in His presence, trusting that your prayers are heard and He is with you in the fire.</li>
</ol>

<h2>✨ Devotional Reflection</h2>
<p>In the furnace of affliction, we discover not only God's power, but His presence. He is the God who saves—not always by avoiding trials, but by redeeming them. Whether the fire refines or releases, He is faithful.</p>

<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You that You are with us in it and through it. Teach us to trust You not only in the deliverance but in the delay. When the flames rise and the waters deepen, remind us: You’re not absent—you’re near. And Your presence is our greatest promise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
