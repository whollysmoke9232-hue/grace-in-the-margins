      <h2>📖 Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,<br>
for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.”</em><br>
–Philippians 2:12b–13</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>✨ Devotional: God Works, So We Work</h2>
<p>There’s a beautiful mystery in the Christian life:<br>
We are called to work—yet we are not alone in the work.<br>
We are called to obey—yet even our obedience is fueled by grace.</p>
<p>Paul’s words in Philippians 2 remind us that sanctification is not passive.<br>
We don’t drift into holiness.<br>
We pursue it.<br>
We “work out” our salvation—not to earn it, but to express it.<br>
This is our responsibility: to actively seek obedience, to grow in grace, to become more like Christ.</p>
<p>But here’s the good news:<br>
We don’t do it in our own strength.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For it is God who works in you…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is the One who stirs our hearts, who shapes our desires, who empowers our actions.<br>
He gives us both the will and the ability to do what pleases Him.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 Work Out, Not Work For</h2>
<p>Notice Paul doesn’t say “work <em>for</em> your salvation.”<br>
He says “work <em>out</em>.”</p>
<p>Like a seed that grows into a tree, salvation planted in us by grace must be cultivated.</p>
<ul>
<li>We water it with prayer.</li>
<li>We nourish it with the Word.</li>
<li>We prune it with repentance.</li>
<li>And God gives the growth.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🎯 For His Good Pleasure</h2>
<p>Why do we do this?<br>
Not for applause.<br>
Not for approval.<br>
But for <strong>His pleasure</strong>.</p>
<p>God delights in our obedience—not because He needs it, but because it reflects His own work in us.<br>
When we walk in His will, we bring joy to His heart.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Father, thank You for working in me.<br>
Thank You for giving me both the desire and the strength to follow You.<br>
Help me to take my walk with You seriously—to pursue holiness with reverence and joy.<br>
Let my life be a reflection of Your grace at work in me.<br>
May everything I do bring pleasure to Your heart. Amen.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>💡 Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Sanctification is your responsibility—<br>
But it’s also God’s activity.<br>
He works in you, so you can work it out.<br>
And when you do, it brings Him joy.</p>
