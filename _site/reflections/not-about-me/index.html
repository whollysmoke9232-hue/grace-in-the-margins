<h2>🧎‍♂️ A Meditation in Suffering</h2>
<p><em>O God, this isn’t about me at all;</em><br>
<em>It is about You.</em><br>
<em>It has always been about You.</em><br>
<em>You alone.</em></p>
<p><em>How could I think that any of this was for me?</em><br>
<em>All of this is to bring You glory.</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t see the end.</em><br>
<em>I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.</em><br>
<em>Men will turn to You.</em><br>
<em>They will know that You alone are God;</em><br>
<em>The only God who delivers men from Sin.</em></p>
<p><em>It is You who rescues,</em><br>
<em>You who redeems,</em><br>
<em>You who lifts my soul from the grave.</em><br>
<em>It is You who has set my feet on a firm foundation.</em></p>
<p><em>You are God.</em><br>
<em>To You I give my life.</em><br>
<em>To You I offer my worship.</em><br>
<em>My life is in Your hands.</em><br>
<em>There is nowhere I would rather be.</em></p>

<h2>🙏 Reflection</h2>
<p>This meditation is a surrender—not to suffering, but to the sovereignty of God.<br>
It’s a declaration that even pain has purpose when it brings Him glory.<br>
It’s a reminder that redemption is not just a rescue—it’s a revelation of who God is.</p>
