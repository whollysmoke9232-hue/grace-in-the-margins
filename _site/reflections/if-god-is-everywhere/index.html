      <h1>If God Is Everywhere All The Time…</h1>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then I do not merely walk with Him—
I exist within Him.
I breathe in His presence,
and He breathes through mine.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then &quot;as far as the east is from the west&quot;
is still within His embrace.
There is no exile from His love,
no distance from His gaze.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then He sees me as I am,
as I was,
and as I will be—
all at once.
Not in sequence, but in fullness.
Not in progress, but in completion.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then He knows everything that can be known about me—
and infinitely more.
The things I hide,
the things I fear,
the things I don't yet understand about myself—
He holds them all without flinching.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then what I call an obstacle
is both there and not there.
It is real in my time,
but resolved in His.
It is a shadow cast by a light I haven't yet seen.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then He is not &quot;working on me.&quot;
He has already finished.
I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then all of my current and future problems
have already been solved.
All of my questions
already answered.
I am not waiting for clarity—
I am walking toward it.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then maybe when I get to Heaven,
I'll realize I've been there all along.
That eternity was never a destination,
but a dimension I was always tethered to.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then even my sins and weaknesses
will become stained-glass windows—
broken pieces made beautiful
by the light of His grace.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then the power that created galaxies
and raised Jesus from the grave
dwells in me.
Not metaphorically.
Literally.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then I am connected to everything—
because everything exists within Him.
Every atom, every angel,
every moment, every miracle.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,
then nothing is impossible for me.
Because nothing is impossible for Him.
And He is not just beside me—
He is in me.
And I am in Him.</p>
