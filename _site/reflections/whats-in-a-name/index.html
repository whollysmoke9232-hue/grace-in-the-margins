      <h1>What's in a Name? Embracing Our True Identity</h1>
<p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> Daniel 1; 3; 6:1-24</p>
<h2>Names Then and Now</h2>
<p>In our modern culture, names often feel like little more than labels. They help distinguish us in a crowd or on a roster, but they rarely carry deep personal significance. I remember a year when it seemed like every other girl was named &quot;Linda&quot; – a popular name, but not one tied to destiny.</p>
<p>Yet, in the Old Testament, names were profoundly meaningful. A name was often a sentence, a prayer, or even a prophecy. It was a declaration of who a child would become in God, linking them to a specific relationship with the Divine. Children grew up understanding that their identity, their character, and their life's purpose were intricately tied to their name. What we do often arises from who we believe ourselves to be. Knowing our identity becomes our destiny.</p>
<p>Consider the names of Daniel and his friends (Daniel 1:5-7):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel:</strong> &quot;God is my Judge&quot; (meaning God is also his Savior or Deliverer).</li>
<li><strong>Hananiah:</strong> &quot;The LORD is gracious&quot; or &quot;gives favor.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Mishael:</strong> &quot;Who is like God!&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Azariah:</strong> &quot;The LORD is my helper&quot; or &quot;my strength.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These names reveal more about God than about the boys themselves. Their self-worth was bestowed upon them because of who God is. When we grasp our identity in God, our feelings and behavior naturally follow.</p>
<h2>The Mission to Babylon</h2>
<p>These four boys, possibly disciples of Jeremiah, were around fifteen years old when they were thrust into the heart of Babylon, a pagan empire. God sent them on a mission: to bring King Nebuchadnezzar to Him. All they had was their true identity. Because they knew who they were in God, they would behave accordingly and consistently, even in the &quot;headquarters of hell.&quot;</p>
<p>The very first thing Nebuchadnezzar did was change their names. Satan understands the power of identity. He seeks to give us names that link us to lies, names that draw us away from God's truth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belteshazzar</strong> (Daniel's new name): &quot;You are now under the authority of Bel,&quot; a chief Babylonian god.</li>
<li><strong>Shadrach</strong> (Hananiah's new name): &quot;Under the command of [the god] Aku,&quot; the moon god.</li>
<li><strong>Meshach</strong> (Mishael's new name): &quot;Who is like Sheshach,&quot; a goddess of lust.</li>
<li><strong>Abednego</strong> (Azariah's new name): &quot;Servant of Nego,&quot; the fire god.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn't it interesting that in Sunday School, we often learned their vile, satanic names? We rarely hear &quot;Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.&quot; Yet, these boys continued to live out their <em>God-given</em> names, not the names forced upon them by their captors.</p>
<h2>The Names We Believe</h2>
<p>Just as Nebuchadnezzar tried to rename Daniel and his friends, Satan constantly tries to name us. He whispers: &quot;You're no good.&quot; &quot;You can't do that.&quot; &quot;You never get anything right.&quot; &quot;You're stupid.&quot; &quot;Unlovable.&quot; &quot;Worthless.&quot; He also uses seemingly positive names to define us outside of God: &quot;popular,&quot; &quot;good looking,&quot; &quot;wealthy.&quot; He even uses comparisons: &quot;Why can't you be more like your brother?&quot;</p>
<p>We are also named by others' sins, by their approval or disapproval. The world system names us by race, gender, status, and so much more. If we don't know that we are loved and named by God, we'll endlessly search for our identity. We'll be so empty inside that we'll accept whatever name the world or the enemy wants to call us. And once we accept that name, we'll act consistently with it – even if we hate the results. &quot;Oh, that's just dumb old me…&quot; &quot;I'm always a failure…&quot; &quot;There goes my temper again…&quot;</p>
<p>Many sermons try to change behavior, but they often ignore the critical step of helping us change our identity. We promise God, &quot;This week will be different,&quot; but we often fall back into old patterns. We try to change our behavior when what we truly need is embrace our true identity.</p>
<h2>Your New Name in Christ</h2>
<p>The good news is, in coming to Christ, we have died to our old names. We are no longer where we were; we are no longer who we were. We are now <strong>&quot;in Christ.&quot;</strong> We have been given a new name – His Name. We have taken on His identity. The Holy Spirit joins us to Christ, making us new creations. In the early church, many were given a new name at baptism, giving rise to the concept of a &quot;Christian&quot; name.</p>
<p>Of course, the old names still try to resurface. But God calls us by new names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Christ is in me.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dances with God.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Lord is my refuge.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Lord is my Shepherd.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Loved by God.</strong></li>
<li><strong>More than a conqueror.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Salt of the earth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Light of the world.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The righteousness of God.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Washed in the Blood of the Lamb.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My name is not based on what others have called me, nor is it based on my behavior. My name is based on who Jesus is and His perfect behavior. It's His identity that totally transforms us. <strong>Who I am in Christ is WHO I AM!</strong></p>
<p>When we act inconsistently with our new identity, we often feel upset. This very feeling proves we have a new heart! The old self might have loved sin; the new self hates it. Our discomfort when we fall into sin confirms that we are acting inconsistently with who we truly are in Christ. Because we know our true name, our behavior naturally begins to follow.</p>
<p>They can call us what they like, but if they don't use our new name, we don't have to answer. Nebuchadnezzar could declare, &quot;Daniel is gone, Belteshazzar is in!&quot; But Daniel just smiled and said, &quot;I know my name. You can call me what you like, I know my name.&quot;</p>
<p>The church might say, &quot;Change your actions.&quot; But the Bible says, &quot;Change who you are!&quot; Until you embrace your new identity in Christ, you have no lasting hope of changing your behavior.</p>
<p>Think of the hundreds of young men taken into Babylon with Daniel. We only know four of their names. The rest, despite having Jewish names, likely didn't truly know their God-given identities. Because they hadn't embraced who God said they were, they were swept along by Babylonian culture and religion. We don't even know their names today.</p>
<p>These four knew their names. And when a crisis came, they didn't have to pray about <em>who they were</em>; they simply <em>were</em> who they were. Daniel could confidently declare, &quot;I am not who you call me. I am who I am. And if you have to kill me, go ahead. God is my Judge!&quot;</p>
<h2>Five Steps to Living Your New Identity</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Become aware of the false identities</strong> you have accepted for yourself – the lies you've believed.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize how those false identities have bound you</strong> and limited your life.</li>
<li><strong>Forgive those who may have &quot;named&quot; you</strong> with hurtful words or actions.</li>
<li><strong>Renounce those old names and identities</strong> – declare them dead in Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Meditate on your true name in Christ</strong> – begin to know who you really are. Call yourself by your new name in Him.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might feel awkward at first, like a newborn baby in adult-sized jeans. But as you grow into who God says you are, one day your new name will fit perfectly.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>What names has the world, or even your past, tried to give you? What new names does God speak over you in Christ?</p>
<p>How can embracing your true identity in Him empower you to live differently this week?</p>
